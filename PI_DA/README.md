# Data Analytics Integrator Project

In this project we will follow the guidelines presented in the following repository: <https://github.com/soyHenry/PI_DA>.

## 0. Project Summary

The primary aim of the Data Analytics Integrator Project is to provide Henry students with hands-on experience in the field of data analytics by engaging them in addressing a real-world issue. This particular challenge involves the analysis of a dataset pertaining to homicides resulting from road accidents in the city of Buenos Aires spanning the years 2016 to 2021.

## 1. Project Objectives

The general objectives of the project can be outlined as follows:

- Generate useful information for local authorities to take actions in order to reduce the amount of fatal victims in road accidents.
- Using an exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify anomalies or curious trends in the road accidents that lead to fatalities.
- Propose, measure, plot and analyse different KPIs.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for a comprehensive storytelling of the data.

## 2. Audience Identification

The audience of this project are the Henry Mentors that are going to evaluate it. For them, the most important part is the information and analysis more than the process or coding to get there. Hence, the whole results will be focused on the former.

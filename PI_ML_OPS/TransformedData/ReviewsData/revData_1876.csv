,"Posted November 23, 2014.",,300040,3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful,True,"Pros : One of the most beautifully rendered and visually stunning games Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Unique and engaging crafting system and player economy system. Easy to level with challenging quests, side quests and minigames. Unique and innovative combat and character skills systems. Ability to purchase in game content that aids in raising skills or earn similar content with your own in game time and effort.Cons : The game is a little complicated to learn to begin with. One cannot simply dive in and understand the systems without going through the tutorials and I highly recomend reading the wiki and watching the tutorial videos that are available. The open pvp system is really kind of a let down for me, it encourages targeting of new and lower level characters by those who have higher levels and for my tastes really hurts the new players over all experience. While I applaud the ability to earn decent equipment and skills through time and effort. I still find that the real game perks lean toward those who pay for the vip status. Not so much that I would call it an outright pay to win game but enough to hinder some of the gameplay for me and make leveling a bit of grind.Over all I love the game. There is still a lot for me to learn about it and the team is developing new content and recently brought a new server online as well. If you love adventure RPG's and dont mind taking the time to learn the new and innovative systems then Divine Souls is definately worth trying."

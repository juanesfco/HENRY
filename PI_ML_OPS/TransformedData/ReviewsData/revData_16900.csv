,"Posted July 6, 2015.",,261570,No ratings yet,True,"recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action platformers. game is really smooth, mechanics are fun and intresting to use, power up system is nice and easy to understand, UI is easy to use and even though it recommends to use controller I have only used Keyboard and mouse dont see any where having a controller is an advantage if anything it can be a disadvantage in the deflect system"
,"Posted February 14, 2014.",,225360,No ratings yet,False,"game is fine and fun but from what i have played i wouldnt not play it for too long... Dont get me wrong i enjoy the steath game but come on why does the movement through cover seems so jotty and switching is rediculously clunky and a little broken (good broken=OP) and its not like with a full FOV most of things you want to see and can get you alerted is always just out fo sight and gets u into trouble a fair bit plus the feeding mechanic is rediculously long hold timmer for you to feed, half the time you tend to kill the people u are will to feed on and feed in people you want to kill..the shadow power feel amazing but as like the cover it is clunky and restrictive as wellI do enjoy it but not enough to give it a thumbs up and to replay itohh yeah the 2 times save funtion deals a good challenge..  i dont know if it has checkpoints cause I ust could not bear to play it any longer"

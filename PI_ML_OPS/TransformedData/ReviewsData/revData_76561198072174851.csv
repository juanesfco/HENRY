Bad Rats has a genius plot with many endings, there is 42 plot twists and i enjoyed all of them, the game runs at 12 fps, usually i would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about that but it gives this game a 'edge' and its ingenius and unique for it.My only problem is that its 1$, i personally think this game is worth 60-90 USD."

The game is terribly optimized and everything is streamed from there servers, and that's ok if you have a monster PC and live in a country with good internet speed (not Australia like myself) . If you have these requirements then buy away. The game is great, balanced fun to play, and amazing with the awesome destuctive units"

Classes, Teams, Robots, Halloween, weapons, Pyro, to many spies, sentry nests, and of course, hats? Look that workshop love it, enjoy the game, it's free and probably better than some of the $60 games on steam! Everybody I present to you Valves Team Fortress 2."

SO glad I got it on steam, becuase I now have endless replay ability with mods and maps and multiplayer. Thank god there is another one coming out soon. 9/10 Buy it it's totally worth it"

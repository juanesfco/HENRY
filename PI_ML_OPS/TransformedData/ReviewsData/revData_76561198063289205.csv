,"Posted February 14, 2014.",,220160,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is one of the best games i have ever played. i has all sorts of maps from hill climbs to freefallers. the one thing that i dont like about it though is the tilting but thats just me. All that aside it is a really good game. 90/100

,"Posted March 26, 2014.",,249130,No ratings yet,True,"This game is a very good game for all ages. it dose not make anyone of any age feel like their ;eft out. Although the missions a fair =ly long but hay, thats lego games. One thing i found a little bit anyoing was the fact that free roam had to be unlocked; its unlocked after you finish the story but still it would be nice. This game is a game well worth what you pay for it. 9/10"

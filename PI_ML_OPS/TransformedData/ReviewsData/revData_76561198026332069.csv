,"Posted December 30, 2014.",,241930,No ratings yet,True,it does not take long to finish the main story line in this game so imo get this game if you feel like you will want to finish every little side quest and find every artifact and herbs otherwise if you are like me and like getting to the main point and story line then you will finish this game very quickly but overall i do recommend this game.

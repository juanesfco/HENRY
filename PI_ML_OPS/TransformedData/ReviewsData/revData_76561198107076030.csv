Settle down to create a hexagonal city. Battle your rivalling nations over hexagonal battlefields. Explore to discover hexagonal banana trees. Then build a spaceship to escape your fear of hexagons.

Mourn for your dead son Shaun, then promptly adopt a new son with the same name. Realize that he is older and richer than you so you decide to marry him instead. Bethesda didn't code homosexuality so download a mod that creates randomly generated bananas."

Go hunting for ducks, shave a yeti for its fur and buy a mountain dew, a pack of doritos and a gun from a vending machine, all while rocking a skin that makes you look like a walking banana."

Spend countless years earning credits from a restless job just to afford a banana. Refuse to provide for your family so you can afford a second one.

PFFFFFTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!! biggest load of ♥♥♥♥ ive even read, This game is still full of bugs that havnt been adressed since release. You can easily lose over 20+ hours of work with a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing bug, Today i tamed an Argy for 9 hours only for it to fall through the map within 20 mins...... GG would not reccomend"

It is basically a race to see who can farm the most, so for the people not in a big clan are at a massive disadvantage(shared XP), This also means you cant come into a wipe half way through anymore! it requires many hours if not days just to aqquire anything decent! I hope the devs are reading this! We want Rust back!!"

,"Posted July 19, 2015.",,304050,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,I dont really like this this game while playing by myself but its really nice when you're playing with other people. I'm not really into block games but this one is the best i've played so far. The collectable items and the worlds are pretty nice so overall i think this game is good. But there are some things they could improve like the fact that the game is to easy i already made it to lv10 and got to the last world and now i'm practically a master in this game and i did this in 2 days. And another improvment they should do is expand the backpack. But other than that i think this games pretty good. THANKS FOR READING.

Vermintide really has some potential and I am positive that it will only get better and better from hear on out. It gives a new hope for the Warhammer Fantasy world since the devastating fall of Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, which I loved to bits.Warhammer: The End Times - Vermintide will not disappoint YOU!"

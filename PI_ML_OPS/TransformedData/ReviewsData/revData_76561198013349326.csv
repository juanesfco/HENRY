Unless you're a very creative person you're probably better off not buying this game until a few more updates come around. At the moment all you can really do is build, sure there are missiles and weapons but you only get to use em against either meteorites or other players, and that's assuming you have a good connection.So buy it if you're not patient or creative. Otherwise, just wait a bit more to see if this game becomes something you'd like to play before deciding."

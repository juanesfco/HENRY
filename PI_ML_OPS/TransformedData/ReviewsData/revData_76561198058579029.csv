As such, this game is quirky and follows suit with bastion but ups the difficulty changes the gameplay from hack and slash to strategy/tactics. The gameplay is all about and hugging cover from enemy fire and lighting them up in succession with your abilities. The ability system is great giving you the ability to experiment with strategies and combining abilities into one set (meaning you can ultimately change your play style at will). As for the atmospher; its another story, great jazz, a neo-twenties city and a smooth talking sword to give you insight into the lore"

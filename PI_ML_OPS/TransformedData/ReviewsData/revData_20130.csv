,"Posted April 4, 2015.",,205950,No ratings yet,True,"This is the kind of game you buy to hint to devs that 'I want the next game in the series, nobody actually wanted this. Im a greedy ♥♥♥ consumer and ill never be satisfied  regardless of what you do, devs are all just placed on a scale of how dissapointed I am in them' 10/10 would buy this for the next game in the series."

,"Posted December 19, 2013.",,218230,No ratings yet,True,I like it cause although it is not advertised it actually has guns and from these gun comes bullets and from these bullets comes litter. Who cleans this litter you ask no-one it just goes poof into thin air. All armies within this game have been genetically modified to not use the restroom. I give this game a 9/10 for environmental awareness.

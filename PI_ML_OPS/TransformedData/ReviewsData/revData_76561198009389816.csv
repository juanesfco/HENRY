This twich however is no normal twitch as it quickly spreads  engulfing my entire body, causing it to violently convulse. I collapse to the floor writhing in pain as blood squirts from from every possible orifice of my body. Blood soaked tears stain my clothes as I realise....I'm not man enough for realism mode.10/10 would bang ,Play this game"

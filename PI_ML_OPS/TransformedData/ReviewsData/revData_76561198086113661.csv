This game on its own is a milestone in game development and the developers should be creditted on innovative and often crazy ideas. Although the game is plagued by multiple bugs, I would still happily fly through space and chill.This at times beautifully crafted exploration game is held down by poor optimisation and multiple bugs.7/10 All it needs is some tweaks to optimisation and bugfixes and this game could be a 9/10."

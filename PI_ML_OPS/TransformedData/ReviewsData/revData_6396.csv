It is incredibly addicting.Pros:+ the combat is alright, it is a bit hard to control which direction you want to swing your sword but i really am enjoying it. you can shatter enemy shields aswell which i thought was sick+you can control a massive army whilst actually being in the battle+lots of different styles of fighting+can have hundreds of units on a battlefield (can mod it up to 1000units or more)+tons of mods+can start as a peasant and end as a kingCons:- graphics are very low quality- hard for begginers- old game (sequel coming out soon)its cheap, and if you enjoy medieval theme, big battles, and massive rpgs, then give it a go."

I do recommend Total war: Attila as it's a great total war game and new total war players as well as the veterans will enjoy playing for hours. but on the other hand I'am very disappointed with the way they are selling this game they should be ashamed for selling factions as DLC's, especially at $7.99 for 3 factions! and so close to the release of the full game, just release the complete game and stop making players pay for it in overpriced intallments!"

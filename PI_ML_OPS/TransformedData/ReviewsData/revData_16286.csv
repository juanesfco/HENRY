They even silence reviews, as i heard, ban people for playing music on Brian Hicks' stream and then deny it while blocking the banned person's posts on forums and even Reddit with all the evidence that he needed to prove himself.The devs should've kept progress with the mod, not start afresh with a full game that has been in alpha for 2 years.You guys promised us so much yet you keep working on entirely different aspects, then put a big lable 'Early Access' as an excuse for slow development"

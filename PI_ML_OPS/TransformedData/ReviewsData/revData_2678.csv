Not only is it a easy program to use, it is based of Team Fortress 2. so you can simply play normally, and create movies. The Source Filmmaker allows much more than other animation program in my opinion. It is very fun to use with camera detection, and to make anything you want. Based on anything, anywhere."

But also, this game is more mind blowing than anything you have ever played. It's not just a horror game, it's a story!"

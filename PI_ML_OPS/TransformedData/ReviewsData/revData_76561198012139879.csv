All core elements were used to their full potential.I didn't find zooming on my camera to be all that useful, but it's a fun little feature nevertheless.From beginning to end, the game gives you this great, eerie feel about it. You know from the start that you're in for a roller coaster adventure, but you won't know what way it's going to go until it's too late to turn back.Even after playing this game through once, I was still scared to play through a second time. And on that, both times I was too afraid to play it solely by myself.Fantastic game, worth the purchase, however, the ending was pure ♥♥♥. Seriously. Just ♥♥♥."

It would be nice if the game were ported and configured to be a bit more PC friendly like the franchise's newest addition.But this aside, DMC3 is definitely my all-time favourite game in the series.The controls are solid, the game feel is fluid, and it's just dang fun to play! I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first. It's only the prequel to events leading up to the rest of the games.Granted DmC Devil May Cry takes the title of complete prequel, Devil May Cry 3 is just the best game in the whole series."

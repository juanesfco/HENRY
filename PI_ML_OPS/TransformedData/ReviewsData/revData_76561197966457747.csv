I really tried SO hard to love this game.It's simply not fun.  I made it almost half way without cheats.And even the devmode cheats couldn't get me through.I will not finish this game.Would be great if the AI weren't gods among men (and I'm on the easiest setting)edit:  AMD FX 8350, single R9 270x, 16GB ram, 7200RPM HDs"

The game is great, but it's best with full 4P multiplayer.Strategy will come into play on harder levels, since you have a limited about of weapons to carry and type-of-units to be able to build, but when things get intense, the result can be very rewarding."

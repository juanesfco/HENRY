Why do you have to do weird analog actions to tag rather than just go past them? And why can you do nothing about the enemies other than just run away? Seriously, I take the stairs more than I grind in this game because the enemies ai can't follow you up and gives up and soon as you step on them, and getting any speed on the grinds is far more laborious than it needs to be. The old xbox game was about freedom, ease, and speed. This version takes all of that and ruins it. DON'T BUY!"

The combination with voilence and all the little jokes kept me smiling all the way through the game. Everyone was hoping it to be just as good as the first one, but let me tell you thus it exceeds it in anyway. The new side missions are not as rewarding as i would have hoped for but they still are good. Terraphormes was a bit like crawmax but did not give as much loot which was a bit of a downer but the addition of a few new wepons balaenced it out perfectly. I have yet to buy the DLC but when i do it gonna be AWESOME so anyone who like jampacked action with a great sense of humour im warning you if u dont get this game U ARE MISSING OUT"

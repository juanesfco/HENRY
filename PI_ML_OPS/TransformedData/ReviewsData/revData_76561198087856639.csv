The style of game this is makes it amazing, it gives you a sense of urgency as you don't have much time to decide on life or death situations. This game offers so many possiblities for different storylines it makes you want to play it as many times as you can to see what is different. Your choices decide how the ending goes down but what choices you make also don't effect what happens in the end. I would always recommend this game."

Don't Starve Together is rewarding as you can slay monsters togther, create tactics for hunting and have 2x (more depending on the players,) the productivity. But in a hilarious and fun way in can be more punishing. Food is more scarce, there are more monsters and when a mate gets killed, his ghost will haunt you and drive you to suicide!If you love Don't Starve and have a friend or two who also enjoys the game, buy this and you will have hours, and hours of fun. If your a tight-♥♥♥ like me, just wait untill it becomes free."

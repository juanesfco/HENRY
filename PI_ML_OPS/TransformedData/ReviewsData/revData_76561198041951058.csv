,"Posted September 25, 2015.",,304030,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,Got to max level in under 3 weeks and then got annoyed at the ping in pvp. If PVE is all your interested in then this is fine for you but players with lower ping do get an advantage in all combat because there is no queing for spells.The world is beautiful with lots of different places to explore. The trading system is really good and the House/Boat building is excellent if you can find a block of land.

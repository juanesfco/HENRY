Season the pork well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in the bottom of a large casserole or frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pork and slowly cook until golden. Remove it from the pan and wipe out the excess fat with kitchen paper.Bring the milk to just under the boil in a large saucepan. Heat the butter in the casserole. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the pork.Add enough of the milk to come about a third of the way up the side of the pork. Drop the strips of lemon peel (minus any white pith) into the milk and bring to the boil.Cover with foil or a lid, and transfer to the oven. Cook for 1 hour then remove the cover and continue to cook for a further 30 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat. Serve the pork in slices, accompanied with the reduced milk.top tipsThe milk will reduce to a lovely, soft, golden, lemony curd. Spoon this around the meat when you serve it.This game is bad."

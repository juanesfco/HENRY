For example, sometimes i shoot a NPC it took a bit of time before it actually deals damage to it, and hackers srsly? they shredded our health withing a few seconds. Mainly after completing the main story is all about the DZ full of griefers. so if anyone is reading this thing pls do not buy this darn game!"

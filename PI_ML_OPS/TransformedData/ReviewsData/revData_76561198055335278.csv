,"Posted April 5, 2015.","Last edited April 5, 2015.",335300,0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful,True, Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin   Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin  was ment to be 20x harder I only found it a bit harder then the original but  in the ways they made it harder they also made it easier. New players just picking up darksouls 2 Scholar of the First Sin will have a hard time because the enemies just swarm you its not 1 enemy then 1 enemy etc etc like it was in darksouls 2. OVER ALL SCORE  Hardness   7.5/10 - Much more difficult with the addition of more NPC invades altho they removed a lot of features from 2 (to try and balance it out). Players that are new to darksouls (Haven't player the other 2) will find this really hard  Enjoyment  8/10 - I had a lot of fun playing thing over it was fun knowing that the enemies were in different places  and i didnt really know what to expect. Allt hough it was still darksouls 2 but changed it a bit more so not as fun as picking up a new souls game and doing a blind run

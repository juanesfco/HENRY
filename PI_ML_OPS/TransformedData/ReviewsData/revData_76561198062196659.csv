,"Posted February 22, 2015.","Last edited February 22, 2015.",289881,No ratings yet,False," IMPORANT PARTI would only recommend this if you want the 10 levels. Everything else just isn't worth it. Even then, $10 for 10 levels. I can't legitimitely recommend this for the slaughterdome. It could be good, but there are too many quirks that can't make it enjoyable. END OF IMPORTANT PART  ALSO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR MAIN GAME RestPros:- Conversations between Gaige & Axton, some humorous moments.- One new class mod for all classes (I think) that boosts Cryo damage + chance, but the skills aren't that useful.- A few new weapons, which have good effects but not worth $10- 10 new levels-Some enemies seem to always drop white lasers, so you could Grind them alot or use them in 'To Arms!'- Some nice skins, including one that is unlocked for all characters (Basically transforms your character into an Eridian version)Cons:- The soundtrack is re-used from Tycho's Ribs/Eleseer- The only enemies you will face are Dahl soldiers & Eridians. The only 'bosses' are Flameknuckle, a miniature Destroyer, and the powersuit Felicity. All 3 of these appear in the main game, only that you can't fight powersuit Felicity.- In some rounds, you'll spend more time looking for enemies than actually fighting them. If the map had less areas that 'stuck out' from the main area, that'd make it better.- The enemies don't give that much XP. If you want XP fast, go farm RedBelly.- Very bland. In other slaughterdomes, you had a great soundtrack & variety of enemies. This is a relatively boring soundtrack and about 4 or 5 different type of enemies."

THE ONLY THING ABOUT CSGO IS, PLAY WITH FRIENDS, It only makes the game more exciting. CS:GO is extremely competitive, most people dont like that but that is the reason I like CS:GO."

It is soo cleverly designed and well done. It takes time to get used to I would definitely admit but after a week playing you cant stop. The fact that Team Fortress 2 is not competitive and that its free, its a awesome game!"

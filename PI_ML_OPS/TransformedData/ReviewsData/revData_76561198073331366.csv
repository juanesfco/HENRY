,Posted June 5.,,394230,3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful,True,battleborn or know has BB is good for any persone who loved to play borderlands to which i am not say people who love borderlands will love this but this games does take it's humor from borderlands. the colour on the maps are good but thanks to the voting system for pvp or pve you will get sick of the same map like in pvp incusion everyone picks overgrowth. the 25 or + depending when read is a very diverse group of charaters to play like a bird with a rocket launcher to penguin in a mechsuit . but the matchmaking has slowen down cause of overwatch or know as OW  bylooking the same and being advaveiced but back to the point.  like borderlands you can farms a boss for a legendary. one major diffence from BB and OW by health is BB heros take a good amount of damage to kill which makes it more rewarding killing a playerShould i buy BB?you should if you got friends wanting to play but if not i would still recomend i would give it a 8.5/10

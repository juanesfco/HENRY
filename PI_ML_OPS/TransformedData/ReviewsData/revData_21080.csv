One's a war themed hat simulator and the other is god simulator.
1 person found this review funny,Posted April 28.,,72760,No ratings yet,True,"I like to think that this DLC is the opposite of Honest Hearts.Honest Hearts takes place in the beautiful Zion Canyon which is teaming with life and lacks the large buildings you might see in The Mojave.Lonesome Road takes place in the giant, irradiated hole in the ground known as the Divide which is pretty much dead save for the Tunnelers, Marked Men and Deathclaws.Honest Hearts is about a fight between a couple of tribes over Zion Canyon.Lonesome Road is about two couriers over not launching a missile.Honest Hearts has She.Lonesome Road has Rawr.Honest Hearts main villian is some bloke with stupid looking dreadlocks.Lonesome Roads main villian is some bloke with stupid looking dreadlocks.... Hold on In all seriousness though I can't recommend this DLC enough.11/10 Needs more Rawr"

,"Posted January 6, 2014.",,239820,No ratings yet,True,What can I say about Game Dev Tycoon.... Well one thing I can say is WHEN WILL I GET THE CHANCE TO MAKE A CONSOLE!!All joking a side though Game Dev Tycoon is a great game.I have had a lot of fun with it and i'm glad I played it. Though I still want to make a console.......9/10

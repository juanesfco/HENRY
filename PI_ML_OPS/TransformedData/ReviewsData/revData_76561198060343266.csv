,"Posted December 23, 2014.",,91310,No ratings yet,True,While it does have a range of glitches and bugs and quirks the game provides a fulfilling experience for people who jus want to enjoy ripping through thousands of zombies and other enemies with the plethora of weapons available for the player to use. I found the game to be fantastic in this way and personally merits its downfalls.10/10 would be a dead island again

,"Posted May 27, 2015.",,730,No ratings yet,True,"Counter-Strike has been around forever and is a competitive FPS staple. The main problem for the casual player is the cancerous community. When playing competitive mode, the higher a players rank goes, the more disillusioned they are likely to become with their fellow players. It would appear that 30-40% of all players are sociopathic teenage boys with severe behavioural problems and high pitched screamy voices."

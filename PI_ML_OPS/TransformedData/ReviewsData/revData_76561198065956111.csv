,"Posted March 17, 2013.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"A source-engine based physics sandbox has got a long way since 2004 when it started as a Half life 2 mod. So much has been added and many user created stuff is allowed in. The best part is that if you have a source engine based game eg. Team Fortress 2 you can use it's content INSIDE Garry's Mod and make animations, weapons etc with the content. Â£6 well spent."

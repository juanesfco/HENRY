Hackers i expected and maybe some bugs but these dlc characters are brocken. one of them puts down a sawblade you cant get around and shoots balls at you i was trapped in a corner multiple times by this thing and i coudnt do anything cept wait to die. the wolf woman is very strong too she has amazing mobilty and escape at many times a could never catch her and she didnt even have movement upgrade and i did... dont buy this game its laggy and still has bugs for a game this old all that should have been fixed shame on the developes for not blancing bug fixing and setting up servers ."

I had a problem with the game when i was going to the steam interface multiple times. but i think everything else runs great.but it's not hard to recommend this game, even in it's development stage.It's an amazing experience for anyone who belongs in the classic genre.Now, Do you know where we can get some health packs? Oh! There's one!"

,Posted June 2.,,17300,5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"pros:-Fun and challenging gameplay (i dunno see for yourself)-Looks godlike even to this day.-requires less ram than ps vita ports (Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus: Shōjo-tachi no Shōmei requires 6GB of RAM for a game that doesn't look or feel very resource intensive. Infact, that game looks like it belongs on PS3 even for the PC version, and the PS3 has 256MB(!) of RAM. Even DOOM (the new one) had a reason to use 6GB+ of memory.)cons:-Limited activations.-Doesn't load on my computer (SteamOS, Windows 7, GTX 950, AMD A4-7300, 8GB RAM) for some odd reason.-No GNU/Linux version."

,"Posted December 29, 2012.",,108710,No ratings yet,True,"I actually really liked this game. I like how it pays homage to what it's influenced by, like Stephen King novels, the Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks etc. Some of the mechanics are a little annoying, but I found the story unique and engaging enough to distract me from that. I recommend that you treat this game as more a supernatural/drama/thriller rather than a horror. While it might have it's moments (I stress the word 'might') it's a game about a horror story, not an actual horror game :D"

Great potential but sadly killed by lack of optimization at this point. Would recommend to people with very HIGH end PC's, from what i felt running around for a short time, world feels alive and full but even if you have a decent rig odds are you wont get more the 20+ frames."

The game and its developers dont deserve the amount of negative reviews it has gotten (real shame!). With base building implemented and there free form placement allows players to build any shape and size base they want. Yes the game isent perfect, there are a few minor issues that im sure are getting worked on (nothing game breaking) but for how its being developed its way ahead of some of the competition. Give it a try.........after all if you dont like it you can steam refund!"

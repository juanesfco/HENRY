For an early access game, it far surpassed my expectations. Have no problems with the game whatsoever, as what I do find slightly weird, if most likely just because it is in early access.(Mobs have really weird behaviours) All in all 10/10"

You want to get a game with people who speak english and dont yell at you in languages you dont understand?  Too bad. Living in Australia means that every single game Im matched with people who dont even speak english, and there is nothing i can do about it. They say you should just team up with mates, yea that would be great, IF I COULD MEET ANY THAT COULD SPEAK ENGLISH. If they added a filter to choose whether you want to play on regional servers, i would probably play this game a hell lot more, except at this point im abandoning games because I cant communicate with my team. Currently rate this game å››/10"
,"Posted January 10, 2014.",,221100,No ratings yet,True,Its a pretty good game so far although there are definitely some bugs. Found ways to see thru walls and interaction pop-ups not always workingDied from falling down a ladder because it wouldnt let me climb down
,"Posted January 2, 2014.",,43160,No ratings yet,True,This was a fun game that i would like to play more of but i might play the first one first. Ending really sucks as i wanted to see what happens to the Dark Ones but oh well. Maybe there will be a number 3
,"Posted November 27, 2013.",,49520,No ratings yet,True,"Is a good game when u have nothing else to do. Although, it can get boring after a while but there a SO MANY DLC's and i got no money to buy dem so im stuck with the original :("

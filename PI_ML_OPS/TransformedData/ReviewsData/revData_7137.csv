This game still has bugs that need fixing, an infamy mechanic that needs more work, and more attention to tweaking gameplay mechanics. Do yourself and consumers as a whole a favor, and wait until it's atleast 75% off steam. This is just an attempt to cash in."

There is practically zero choice in how you decide to approch quests, other than choosing which gun you use to kill things with. It literally doesn't matter what you choose to say during dialogue choices either. All 'choices' will lead to the NPC saying the same bloody thing - no matter if you're rude, polite or sarcastic.I cannot recomend this game out of good conscience to anyone who thinks they'll be playing an RPG. It's a first person shooter, through and through. "

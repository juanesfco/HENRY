BUT HOLY NIPPLE OF ZEUS! not everyone is a hackerIt ruins the mood of the game when a salty opponent starts ♥♥♥♥ing with his ownteam because 'clearly you're hacking m8, uninstall'.In conclusion I F******* love this game, it has great balance, fun mix of explosiveand/or calm gameplay depending on how well the team works togeather.10/10btw pulse is number juan"

Clearly alot of work is yet to be done and everything they add will hopefully work with the game and make it more balanced than it is at this time. But so far i've been impressed with how good the AI is, how smooth the game runs and how smooth the animations are (theres even birds that fly onto your arm time to time) plus crafting and item collecting is simple, just watch out for the tribal patrols. If u've got the $15 and you enjoy survival with a touch of horror u will enjoy this awesome alphaps. personally I haven't encounted any bad AI but I have heard some people have been having trouble with em"

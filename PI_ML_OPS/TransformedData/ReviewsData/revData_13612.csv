Once the world gets to a certain age its all about the 'Pay To Win' and if you want to not die, then you better be playing (and buying) 10+ cards a day.Would totaly recomend you bash your head on your desk for just as much enjoyment."

Well it never got there, it looks nice but the gameplay is totally bland and has nothing unique about it.  It portrays itself as 'epic, complex, and dense' but I would have to say its 100% the opposite; mediocre, simple and  shallow.  On a positive note, if you have children that are under 10 and you are trying to teach them about 4x strategy, this game is a very good training game for them...if it can hold there attention."

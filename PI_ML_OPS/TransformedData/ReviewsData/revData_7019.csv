Combat is different every time and extremely intense. If you like Mil sims that are actually fun buy this game.Cant really explain the experience until you have played it."

,"Posted December 30, 2013.",,209870,No ratings yet,True,This game is a great FPS. It is by far one of the best shooter games i have played and the customization for the weapons and the player is just amazing. It took me a bit of time getting use to the controls and the fast paced action but overall i rate this game 5/5 :)

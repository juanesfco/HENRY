,"Posted December 1, 2015.",,311210,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,False,"I tried the multiplayer and really wanted to like it. I had hoped that they would actually do something different with it. I'll admit the specialists, thrusters, and a few new weapons make it slightly different, but at the end of the day it's still the same ridiculously unbalanced game where the fastest firing weapon wins. With the exception of sniper rifles. HOWEVER The zombies is pretty fun (This coming from the guy who doesn't even like zombies mode.) So if you like zombies, or have a group of friends to play this with in a private lobby than this game is for you. (I guess if you are one of those ♥♥♥♥boys that just buy it every year it's pretty good for you too.)TL;DR: Same game as it always was and will be. Fun zombies. Modding tools will come out in 2016. (looking forward to that)"

,"Posted October 4, 2015.",,303210,No ratings yet,True,"This is one of those games that you need to experience for yourself. If you watch someone play it, it will not have the same impact. If you know things about it beforehand, it won't have the same impact. $10 for a game with ~90 minutes of content may seem like a complete ripoff, but it is not about the game. It is about the message. And if that pricetag is too steep for you I completely understand. But if not I completely recommend this game. There are many debates about whether games are art. I strongly believe that this is a prime example."

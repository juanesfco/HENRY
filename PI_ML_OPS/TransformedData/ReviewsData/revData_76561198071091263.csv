,"Posted October 24, 2014.",,204300,No ratings yet,True,"A great game with lots of content.Pros: Good fighting physics. Lots of cool characters.Cons: I think that the expansion packs are too expensive for only containing a few new characters. I also think that in online games, people without expansion packs should not play with the people who have expansion packs, as it gives an unfair advantage."

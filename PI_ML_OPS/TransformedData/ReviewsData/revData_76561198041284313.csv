Then we would start going out regularly, we would fall in love eventually. We would become the couple that has their own inside jokes and are always teasing each other and everyone else would be jealous of us. We would get married and have a child (Fallout New Vegas, the second best game ever). We would grow old together, on my death bed as I lie there about to draw my last breath, TES: Skyrim looks at me with tears in it's eyes 'Thank you for everything, you were always so good to me' and I would take TES: Skyrimâ€™s hand, look it in the eye and say 'No, thank YOU' then pass away."

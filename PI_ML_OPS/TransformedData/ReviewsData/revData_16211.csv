BUT there are some major problems that need to be fixed1. theres this problem when you have to restart your game otherwise you wont find or successfully join a party.... This get very irritating.2. You cannot have a party with friends and search online. As of now you have to have 4-5 people in a lobby which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its you and a friend.This game is amazing and so far very balanced. This is ver emersive with all the fog and music. One thing i dont like is the constant moaning in your ear from idk what its just too loud. I love this game i do recommend and i hope they fix these bugs

NO this game is AMAZING it is a simulator done right and i enjoy every second. Its a perfect world to survive in with a friend. they say they are going to add much more which i believe such as NPC's and vehicles which is gonna be awesome so i must say its a good buy and very fun.

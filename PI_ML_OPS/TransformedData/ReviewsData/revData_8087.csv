Even if i found the campaign on the short side, you can either buy the DLC Breakdown to get a couple extra hours in or just not do the final mission. This zombie survival game has many things that i look for in most games, even if its coated in large scale bugs.So in short, if you enjoy having a busy schedule and choosing different varients of tasks whilst having fun. go ahead."

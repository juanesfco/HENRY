I would say this is the best VN studio for those who does not keen to jump into coding. Very  nice GUI with drag and drop system.However, this product needs to be more developed as this product does not allow you to do much customizations.For example, customized buttons. So far I only able to make a button with customized image, without any effects :( It is more like a image-button.The positioning tool needs to be developed as well because when I was positioning my button, I could not see my other buttons that I had put on the menu.I will keep updating my opinion as I am still learning the software. I hope this can be helpful."

Purchasing it mid 2011, i have watched it grow from a small, well done sandbox game with 4 bosses to a brilliant, bar setting work of its genre with thousands of items and over 11 bosses.Pros - Dedicated developers- Mounds of content- A high skill cap- Amazing MultiplayerCons- A possible downside, alothough not for myself, could be the particular art style- Some bosses challenging difficulty- Incredibly rare drops that make you farm for hours.This game is amazing, 9.9/10, and every hour ive spent on it has been worth it."

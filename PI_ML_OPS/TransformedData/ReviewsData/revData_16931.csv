,"Posted November 22, 2014.",,57690,No ratings yet,True,"this game is quite in depth and delicate. so many factors to consider and this makes the game very interesting. originaly i bought it because i thought it would be like age of empires or dawn of war,  butt it turns out it's sort of like a mega complicated tycoon game. it's pretty cool"

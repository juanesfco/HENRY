,"Posted June 11, 2015.",,253710,No ratings yet,True,"Disclamer: ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCEThis is game is Amazing in my perspective. It is one of the only truly realistic hunting game out there. While you have to track your animals down really slowly and quietly it makes for a good game because you are constantly looking around trying to be careful while finding the correct tracks for your animal. The way the guns aim, and work make it harder but more fun.Although you have to pay to hunt in other locations and hunt different animals, it is still fun to hunt those damn White Tails. I can take from 20-200 minutes or even more to kill one animal... if you keep scaring it off which makes for great concentration and learning. This game has also improved my eye sight, believe it or not.even with the 'Pay 2 Win' (Not really) more like 'Pay 2 Hunt more animals in different locations' I would give this game a 8/10"

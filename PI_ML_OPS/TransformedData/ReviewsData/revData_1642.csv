Words can never express the satisfaction success brings. 10/10 game - and this is all from before the new updates, which have consistently been better and better throughout the early access process."

Ship types and abilities are diverse and interesting, from devestating broadsides, disabling beams and quick flickering jumps you can utilize to get behind your opponent. The focus on team tactics is strong and the glacial pace (compared to other 'shooters') is a refreshing change - you're forced to think and outmaneouver your enemies instead of just gunning them down."

Either the designs are poor, the funding is clearly lacking and it will never be completed, or they're simply not fun to pay. There's usually a reason a developer can't find a publisher.Not so with Road Redemption. I'm stunned this hasn't been picked up by a publisher already. The visuals are solid, the gameplay is hilarious and bombastic, the weapons and tracks are diverse, interesting and feel excellent to use. Most of all, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing VIDEO GAME. It's such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game you don't even know - it's just a freaking blast to play, a huge amount of fun. The upcoming multiplayer component is extremely promising as well. The only thing lacking might be the music, which is somewhat generic, as well as some variability in the missions. However, the devs seem to have their heads screwed on right and this promises to be a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game.Give them your money, now."

My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now."

For those of you who are sick of the typical first/third person shooter, or any action game in general, The Stanley Parable will have you laughing your ♥♥♥ off, as you explore the deep, intricate, narrator driven storyline that explores the mundane life of a measley office worker named Stanley on his grand quest to find out why all of his co-workers have suddenly, and mysteriously, disappeared.10/10, must play."

Visual effects and game mechanics are even more beautiful and nuanced than ever, serving to immerse you deep within ceaseless combat. I swear I actually feel cold during the blizzards... They're just so realistic! Definitely a must buy"

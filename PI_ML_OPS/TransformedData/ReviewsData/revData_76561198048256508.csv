Together with the ranks, this game requires you to get more experience to ranklevel up to Tank Crewman and Fighter Pilot etc. which is way better than most games which allow you to instantly get the most powerful weapons but you do not know how to use it. Leveling up and getting experience really does make you more experienced in this game. Most reccomended as a regular player to FPS - Players who prefer realism and fun."

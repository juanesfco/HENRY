Game is amazing in so many ways.Second day I played this I was farmed for hours by veteran players stacking together, who admitted to purchasing the game again to play on low level servers. Third day, same guys, same story.There was multiple active high level servers to play on during these times.Cool game, ♥♥♥♥ (OCE) community.Can't recommend for OCE players, you'll have a hard time learning if my experience is anything to go off."

The graphics and evironment are really well made as well as the sound which coresponse to the gun shots. Be it playing with friends or alone with bots brings never ending thrills. 9/10 Must have if you are a fan of zombie games.

The game is extremely fun and it is free. Items in the game and many types of gamemodes really brings never ending fun to any player who plays the game. 10/10 one of the best free multi-player games out there. A definate 'Must-play'.

Being able to customize and create your own unique character with a skill tree is definately a plus. Overall a 9.5/10. Highly recommended.

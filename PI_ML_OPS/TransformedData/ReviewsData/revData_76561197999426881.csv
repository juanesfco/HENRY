Buttons are hidden by other windows that sit at the top level and can't be dismissed. Some buttons are off the edge of the screen and unreachable.In short the UI is really badly designed and needs an overhall.The rest of the game? Well honestly I barely got a taste so I'll leave those opinions to others.

Rogue Likes are, by their nature, difficult but this is just impossible. You want me to play this again, fix the random number generators so that the game is playable.Character skills are pointless, which defeats the purpose of having them in the first place. If your going to rely purely on a random number generator then just sell that, don't dress it up with pointless character skills."

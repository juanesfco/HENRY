,Posted July 3.,,252490,1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful,True,Me having 500+ hours of Rust must mean that I have a good understanding of this game right. Well I do and this is one of the most fun and intense survival games you will come across no other survival game will give you gameplay like rust this is a unique game that you can either play by yourself or with a group of friends the game never get repetitive and there is always something to do. The dev team behind it is great bringing a new update every friday and talks to the community to see what would make the game better and what makes the game not so great via reddit also the devs listin to the community and to take things that people say into mid. In my opinion I would recomend this game to everyone wether you only play it on an occasion or become fully emersed in the gameplay. 10/10

If you enjoy Shoot'em up games and/or bullet hell games then you will enjoy this game. If you don't enjoy the shoot'em up and/or bullet hell genre than the $12 price tag may seem very off putting, but I would not recommend passing this game up and instead waiting for a sale. This game looks great, sounds great and plays very well, it is a very fun game to play if you are short on time, or even if you just need something to play. Worth a buy"

It has funny characters, a story I genuinely adored playing through, and you can date a skeleton. 10/10It also has amazing music so if you have the few extra bucks I definetely recommend it"

OMNI's hit 'Urban Metaphor' made this game have a ton of hope and potentialThe second update changed the background and some other stuff. The song was still there, which was awesome. My love for this game was playing this one song.Now, THIS update completely took out the song, with a ludicrous background and annoying enemies. It wasn't broken. The game was absoloutley freaking epic how it was before. This new update ruined it's potential. And with a whopping 20 dollars on an indie BETA game, just... no. Bring back the old version. Urban Metaphor was the bomb."

Unbelievably fantastic atmosphere that gives this masterpiece of a game a near perfect score for me.My computer isn't the fastest of all computers and it tends to bug a little bit, but doesn't effect the overall game9.5/10 Would... no, *will* play more"

,"Posted December 24, 2015.",,298030,No ratings yet,True,"Hands down the best RTS game. Thousands of hours wasted in my youth setting up precision attacks with air, land and sea units. Not to mention creating defensive bases that no AI could ever breach, even when you had ten players on a 64x64 map all allied against you.What C&C and Starcraft failed to deliver, TA has covered.About time this came to Steam."

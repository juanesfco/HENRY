Unlike other open world games that have certain rules, this one particular game, have NO rules! if you wanna crash a jet into a guy while have a boat attached to it? No problem!Just Cause 2 is one of these games that people should enjoy as a whole. The mechanics in here are fully fleshed out appart from a few rare bugs I found. The physics is great and hillarious! instead of realistic physics, this game goes for the funny sort of thing. Going on across the map by car WILL take a long time! Out of all the open world games like Saints Row or something, this just NAILED it!. The enviroments are absolutely beautiful. The combat is mostly good as I didn't like the melee that much but however, I didn't mind because most of your time is either spent shooting everything in sight and etc.This game is DAMN GOOD! I reccommend picking up at full price and I cannot wait for Just Cause 3 to come out!-Good-Great Visuals-Great Sound -Hilarious Physics-Lots of fun--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Bad-Few bugs that crashes your game-Melee animationFinal Verdict: 8/10"

,"Posted April 21, 2014.",Last edited August 14.,244850,No ratings yet,False,"Used to be a good game. Now it runs like ♥♥♥♥ and has a bunch of 'content' (i use that word Loosely). I would not recommend buying this until they optimize the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.Pros:- Creative sandbox with space- Functional physicsCons:- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a survival mode- Remove the Dogs, they're a lame excuse for AI and are annoying rather than a challenge- Runs like ♥♥♥♥Summary: Used to be Good, Dev's got lazy, poorly optimized - Don't buy yet."
,"Posted February 2, 2014.",,252490,No ratings yet,True,"I believe this game has some great potential and is generally going in the right direction. I will be interested in the way they will implement the 'Thirst' system as currently water is pretty hard to find. I think one of the biggest problems with this game is hackers and 'Naked' hunters. But this can be solved by good administration and some fair rules. Personally speaking, i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good, realistic survival game with great multiplayer and interesting features."

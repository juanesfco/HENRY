It requires teamwork and the bots are very challenging. You could play this alone or with friends, either way it's very fun to play. Sure, there might be bugs and glitches once in a while but it's to be expected if it's in Early Access, but I've still had fun with it. I recommend this to anyone who just wants to have plain fun!"

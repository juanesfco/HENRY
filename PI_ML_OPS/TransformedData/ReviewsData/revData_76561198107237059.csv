The graphics, moving foliage, lighting is great.Few complaints, however:1. Main campaign is a bit short. I feel like it could've been longer, I finished in 10 hrs of gameplay.2. Lara's face change. I mean, come on. TR 2013's face was so much better. I don't like the new round-face Lara one bit.3. Instead of $70, I would recommend to pay $40. For the short storyline, $70 is a bit steep.4. AMD's TressFX in TR 2013 is a lot better than HairWorks in this one. A lot more of a resource hog is HairWorks.5. The story, no matter how long it is, is a little cliched. We've seen it all before.6. The best parts of the game is post-campaign when you're trying to 100% it.Anyway, I recommend this game. I'm on my way to 100%ing it. Should be fun.- Matt"

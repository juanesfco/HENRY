While Borderlands 2 has the edge on the first in terms of story and dynamics, Borderlands has some great aspects that the sequel lacks. The visuals and soundtrack combine for a realistic and unique atmosphere; while there are clever moments of humour littered throughout the game. One of the best parts is the multiplayer as you can play through the entire story (including side quests) with up to three friends. How cool, right?Would totally recommend!"

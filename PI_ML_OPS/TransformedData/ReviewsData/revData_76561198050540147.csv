This game is very brutal, the carnage in which you can induce upon not only your passengers but other people on the road is insane. If you like GTA V or games of that manner you will LOVE. L.O.V.E. LOVE this game. It features all of your favourite mechanics including; Blinkers, screaming children, red lights and death. Please keep in mind that this game is not for young people, if you are under the age of 17 you should ask your parents first.I personally have not played much time in this game and I already think that it's great9/10 - Chubby Swag"

Zombies spawned far too much and the controls for the helicoper are SO SO SO SO ♥♥♥♥. The trailer and screenshots are so missleading, it looks like a great survival game but all I got was a failed Left 4 dead with ♥♥♥♥ gamemodes."

I was Wondering when i had herd about this game Is the Call of Duty With Hats?? Boy I was WRONG It is far more complex than i had first thought. With hats and very balanced weapons and GOOD Classes and the weapons they have. Good greif the weapons are creative Like: The Toimslav, Huntsman, Rocket and Sticky Jumpers, All the Medi-Guns AND my Personal favorite The Gloves of Running Urgently"

Go get itGuys, the thermal drill. Go get itGuys, the thermal drill. Go get itGuys, the thermal drill. Go get itGuys, the thermal drill. Go get itIn all seriousness, It's a good game, but it has TONS of issues, The base game heists are crap, tons of banks, no flavor in each. Big Bank, GO Bank are the only banks I would do normaly besides Gold heists. There are low levels who blow up the lab in Rats and use Doctor Bags per down INSTEAD OF FAK's. And yes, Bain can be annoying, but he's more funny the more you get used to it, I put over 100  hours into the game, but PD:TH is better in the terms of base game material, while PD2 has more modern RPG trends like: Grinding for mods, masks and money and it has powerfull options through DLC's or the Steam Group. The Heist has more action and better weapons and upgrades. Get 2 if you want more modern trends, Get the heist if you want more action and better upgrade to you and your weapons."

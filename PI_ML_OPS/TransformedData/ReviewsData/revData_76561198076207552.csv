Even though my specs are above the mininum required, even when I disable effects the fps drops significantly in these areas and frankly, it's a bummer. However the gameplay is engaging enough that I can ignore the crappy frame-rate for the most part, and the characters are really interesting so far. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys visual novels or choose-your-own-adventure type games."

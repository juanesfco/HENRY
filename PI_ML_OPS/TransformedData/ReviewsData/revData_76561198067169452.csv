I personally enjoy CSGO, because how it is a mix between aim and strategy. This allow this game to much more in depth and enjoyable. Also, CSGO has every gun available from the start, so no player has an advantage. This makes CSGO all about how good you are, and your team. Teamwork is essential in CSGO. Thats is something I find is needed in todays games, working as team not indiviudally. CSGO is a very well thought out game and will always be remebered by me and the gaming community"

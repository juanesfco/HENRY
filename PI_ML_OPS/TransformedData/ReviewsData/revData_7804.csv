The people are toxic and the game may as well be a Sodium mine because they are all salty as ♥♥♥♥. The only thing I like about this game is destroying a fleet of people with an AWP.EDIT: Please leave me be, GabeN. First TF2 sucks me in, now this."
,"Posted December 29, 2015.",,8870,No ratings yet,True,"I can not reccomend this game enough to those who can get involved in a story and/or who simply like the shoot-em-up style of gameplay with a smidge of tactitioning (The Vigors etc.)Honestly, I had some expectations going into this due to the tremendous hype around it, but I can safely say that the hype was not ill-placed as the story is immensely interesting and gameplay is all-round smooth as can be.(Basically, if you like stories, you're gonna love this)Also, on a side-note, the DLC for this game is the first DLC for any game that I have actually considered worth the investment having completed it.There is endless possibilities for this universe and that is exciting."

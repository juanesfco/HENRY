Beautiful graphics combined with amazing core gameplay and sheer strategy just blows me away. The fundamentals take a steep curve in your learning capabilities but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a beautifully solid game. Absolutely great strategy game with awesome capabilities. 20/10 would bang twice"

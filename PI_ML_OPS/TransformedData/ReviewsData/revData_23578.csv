,"Posted December 31, 2013.",,12120,No ratings yet,True,Grand theft auto: San Andreas is one of the best games and one of the best in the gta series. so much fun lots of missions and a huge place just to mess about. you can even download samp (san andreas multiplayer) so you can have lots more fun with friends. Cheats are one of the best in my opinion you cna spawn a jetpack make everyone go crazy so go and buy it loads of fun

I can see the fairness in that, but what if we're talking non-gameplay advantage mods like graphical and audio mods? Nope, achievements disabled.You need to have a bland experience if you want to get those achievements.Really Bethesda. You should honestly leave the Fallout Titles to Obsidian, at least they won't screw up the fanchise you've adopted."

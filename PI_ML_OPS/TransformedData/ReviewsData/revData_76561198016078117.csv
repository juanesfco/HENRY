,Posted January 10.,,570,No ratings yet,True,"Dota has a love, hate relationship with me. I either really enjoy it or hate its guts. Hero customisation is excellent and has the best graphics MOBAs offer.Gameplay is pretty hit or miss. Play 1000+ hours and you might just reach 3K MMR."

,Posted January 10.,Last edited June 28.,730,No ratings yet,True,"A fast-paced, challenging shooter that has set itself as the hallmark among all First Person shooters. It is a competitive team game that requires the teamwork, skill and endless hours of practice and mastery to beat your enemies.If you have fast reflexes, good muscle memory and love one tapping heads this is the game for you. Almost everyone on steam should give this game a 'CS:GO' at some point."

The perplexing puzzles and thoughtful level design make this game so memorable. Sarcasm and Sardonic humor is sprinkled throughout. Never for one moment does any thing in this game seem like a lazy or poorly crafted addition. Everything works!"

Although the two share the same name, they are completly different concepts. I am beginning to warm to Jagex's AoS more and more by the day...The game is competent in all aspects, but you are going to need a really good rig to get the best out of it.But will never be as good as AoS Classic! Classic is free, and you can download/play it at http://www.buildandshoot.com^ Classic will run on EVERY computer (Looking at you, Felix's HP!) ^"

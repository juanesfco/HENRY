It is truly a delight.The focus on your survival is a great source of challenge in itself before you even factor in Cannibals.I understand many feel a great apprehension about paying for an early access game, but from my experience so far it is well worth the price, it appears beyond that of any beta I have ever played, what's more it's on par if not better then many completed games I have dealt with recently."

This is a great port that I have so far enjoyed great stability. The original 3 Commander Keen games are very simple side scrolling platforms by today's standards, but remain a great source of fun. Though it may not be the best way to spend a day as it was for me back in the day. But considering the price it's a great source of nostalgia, or if you have never played these then it's a good opportunity to live some gaming history.I've never been a huge fan of the latter games, they are okay for a little bit of fun, but I've always found that the general feel of the game and controls were lacking.Disappointing that this pack does NOT include all the Keen games."

The difficulty jumps significantly after the first stage, and the game remains consistently unforgiving.Still a lot of fun, especially for those of us with fond memories of it from back in the day."

A great port. The game is still just as fun as it was back then, though I'm willing to admit I may have the nostalgia goggles on. The levels are well designed, with a desirable and challenging but fair difficulty curb. I recommend."

Then this game is for you. If you have ever played the game 'terraria' you are destined to atleast try this game in your life, if your not famila with that game then i assure you that this is a game that you should buy all year long. Hours of gameplay, rolplay experience, and plenty of action/adventure awaits you in the game of 'STARBOUND'"

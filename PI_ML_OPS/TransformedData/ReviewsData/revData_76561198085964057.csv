Good game actually very good, clocked up to 30 hours playing like 6 hours a day. One problem with it but it may be hard to run considering I have a GTX 760 and get 40 - 50 frames on low and medium settings but the game still looks good at low and medium settings."

Just get the game if you know what your doing otherwise *Wasted* (GTA V reference)

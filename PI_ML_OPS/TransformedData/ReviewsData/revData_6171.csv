Areas are blocked off from the world by invisible walls which in a i guess game genre like this is a bad thing since exploration should reward with loot like a diablo type game but this one completely says ♥♥♥♥ you if u try to think oh hey im gonna explore here. The animations are horrible and the level up system is boring with the oh hey put a few attribute points into this skill and even if i did eventually get spells from skills with the horrible combat it woudlnt matter (acording to a friend this game was also designed for an Ipad im not sure if this is true but what do u expect and at this point i really dont want anything to do with...THIS)

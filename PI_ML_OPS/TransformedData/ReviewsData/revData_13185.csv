This is perhaps one of the greatest games to ever grace mankind. Game devs of the future shall look back upon this gem and hope they can create something with even a fraction of its awesomeness. I cannot recommend this game enough. I have never before, and most likely will never again, play a game that can evoke any and every emotion from me within the first fifteen minutes of playing. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll curse, you'll sing with joy. Anything positive I can say about this game will merely be eclipsed by the actual experience if you decide to pick it up. And so I give this game a score I doubt I'll ever give to any other game in my lifetime, the coveted and sought after: 10/10"

Definitely worth your money especially at a steal of $15. I could have payed $30 for this and wouldn't have been disappointed. If you loved Terraria *cough* Scoots *cough* then you will love this game.9.5/10

If you love Battlefield, or MAG, or any type of game with large-style conflict, you have to try this game. It's transcontinental combat with three factions vying for dominance on a massive scale. With a realistic day and night cycle and more terrain and areas than you can shake a stick at, whilst also being free-to-play, words can't even begin to do it justice. Just give it a try yourself."

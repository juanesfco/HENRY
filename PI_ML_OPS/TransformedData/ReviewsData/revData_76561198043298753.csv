,"Posted December 6, 2015.",,239140,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,This game requires a high end pc but for some reason my high end Alienware Area 51 has lag and needs to be put on medium texture wiich is really a pain because i purcashed this computer to see the graphics and effect come to life not look like a game made in 2000 so i reccommed people who have a very good computer get this rather this is a very good game with a cliche story but with a good use of dead island/mirriors edge so my final verdict is a 7/10

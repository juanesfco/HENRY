,"Posted August 24, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"This game is realistic in everywayGarrys mod stranded a gamemode is very realistic, you press f4, and you press an item, the only way to make a specific item is to have the wood or stone, or iron or ♥♥♥♥♥, so all you need to do is punch a rock and it makes a gun reload sound when you have some, then make something i spawns, then you use a magical gay ♥♥♥♥♥ gun to pick it up and use your mouse in stranded to move it and hold e in stranded and real life, and move it, then all you need to do is right click (very realistic) to  freeze it.FIN"

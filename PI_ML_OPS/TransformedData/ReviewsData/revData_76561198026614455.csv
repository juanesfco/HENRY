A good challenge, no tips every five secconds, battling other armies on planet then sending your forces to other planets via teleportation is sweet and the campaing needs a little bit more content.None the less, the game looks amazing and plays well, i only wish more of my friends had this so i could annihilate them too."

,"Posted March 5, 2014.",,49520,No ratings yet,True,"Amazing re-playable campaing, amazing guns that can be randomly generated so no gun is the same, the dlc is just the campaing waited to be unlocked and played (recomending waiting for sales), enemies are insane once you get to a higher level and evolve to your specific level, loot = infinite and once you get that gun (people who have played it know what i mean) ..... just buy the game"

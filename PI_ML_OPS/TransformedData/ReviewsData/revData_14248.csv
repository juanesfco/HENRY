I've persoanlly been searching for a good Dinosaur game for a while now, and all have been sub-par. All until now, that is. This game is the most exhilirating, most intense, hardcore dinosaur game I have ever played. I would a hundred dollars for this game, but this game is a fraction of the price, making it a must buy, 11/10 would reccomend"

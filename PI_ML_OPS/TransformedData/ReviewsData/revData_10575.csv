,"Posted March 13, 2014.",,250600,No ratings yet,True,"This game is the game of the year, hands down. It is the heartwrenching struggle of a lowly fly to ascend to a higher state of being. The vastly superior, engaging, and thought provoking story is reminiscent of such classics of literature as Animal Farm and The Stranger. It is simply the finest work of art to ever exist.This game also laid eggs in my eye and I spawned forth hundreds of flies.So please play this marvelous masterpiece and spawn its fly babies."

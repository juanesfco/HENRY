,"Posted November 30, 2010.",,400,No ratings yet,True,"Portal is one of those games when you don't need to shoot the hell out of someone to have fun, puzzles and a great storyline can replace that. Portal 2 is coming out and i going to get it to see the storyline and great new gameplay. I Recommend Portal because it is a Great game for a low price and if you really get in to it there is Portal 2 coming out in 2011 Hopfully.-Adobegeek"

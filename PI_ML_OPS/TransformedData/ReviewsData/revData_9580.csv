Determined to ensure that his family will have a secure future, Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime. He proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with one of his former students. The game tracks the impacts of a fatal diagnosis on a regular, hard working man, and explores how a fatal diagnosis affects his morality and transforms him into a major player of the drug trade.9/10"

Pretty much this game is a Crack Addict simulator. Everyone wants to get a little hit of crack, but in the case of this game, crack is actually Hats.12 year olds jump up and down trying to get hats and  ruin a pretty decent game. Besides all the ♥♥♥♥ing hats it's not bad. But you know, Gaben loves his ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions so have fun with your 'Free' game guys. You ♥♥♥♥ing crack addicts. But without the hats and microtransactions, it's not a bad game tbh."

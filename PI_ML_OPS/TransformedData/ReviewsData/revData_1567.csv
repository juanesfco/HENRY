,"Posted June 28, 2014.",,200710,No ratings yet,True,"For so long I was trying to find a good Diablo II style RPG, I had seen torchlight 2 but never considered it and when I finally gave in and got it I played it for days straight, it gave the feeling of Diablo II with a whole lot of new content and addons through steam workshop.

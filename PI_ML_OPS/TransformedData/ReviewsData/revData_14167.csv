It is the kind of game that can also rely on strategy whether it is based on teamwork or just soloing your way through. It gives me a challenge as well compared to any other F2P games and the matches are always long and tedious. I rarely experience any bugs so overall, this game is a (+) to me."

It is fun to click and pop heads in this Third-person shooter and it contains a really sad truth about war.Not gonna spoil much but this game will definitely make you feel like a horrible person. The challenge in changing the difficulty (especially FUBAR) really put me on edge on how carefully I should time,move from cover to cover and shoot even thought it is kinda anooying to die over 50 times. Little details I noticed as well were put into this game, for example, the image of the main menu screen changing as you progress the following chapters and how your characters' gear, mental stability and how badly wounded they are increases as you near the end of the game piqued my interest. In conclusion, this game is definitely a (+) to me."

Along with a variety of easter eggs and clues scattered in the game as you play for players all around to piece together to formulate the backstory of FNAF and FNAF 2, the jumpscares are effective to a certain extent. It is also a challenging game for one to beat but it eventually comes to the point where the game changes from horror to a rage-inducing game. Still a (+) for me anyways and I am looking forward to the sequel to this game."

I was blown away at the detail and interactivity involved in every single object and room in this game. I'm one of those people that has to explore absolutely everything in each game I play, and this definitely kept me on edge. The story was gripping, and along with the visual (and audio) appeal, I'd easily give this a 9/10.This has to be in my top 5 favourite games. Amazing. Nothing short of that. I can't wait to see what else Fullbright come up with next. I'll definitely be buying."

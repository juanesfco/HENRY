Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it."

Terroists have to plant the bomb or protect the hostages while Counter Terroist have to defuse or protect the bomb and extract the hostages. These modes are called Defuse and Hostage, both played in Competitive CSGO. These modes can be played in casual also. There are other modes that include Deathmatch, Arms Race and Demolition. There are a variety of maps and DLC's are dirt cheap.I highly recommend this game if looking for a new, cheap FPS game that you want to have fun with or just play competitevly."

The games mechanics are great and the idea of upgrading and customizing your mechs is just cool. This game has very active developers and it you don't have to pay to win. The game offers things to be bought like Airmech Prime which gives you nearly all troops, all mechs, silver vip and gold vip for 30 days + more. This game is great and I highly recommend it."

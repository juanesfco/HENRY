Seeing all my OP friends makes me want to grind like they did to achieve maximum bada**ery. However it is a grindy game and as a driving game guy not really my type either. That being said I still recommend this game to people considering it, it's free so give it a shot[EDIT]I've played 441 minutes in this session alone.. make it stop.."

I had a lot of fun with friends when I picked it up on the free weekend that Overkill was doing. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though as there is a lack of content and only so much replayability. If you can get this and/or Payday 2 on a good sale then I highly recommend it

So I made an even bigger ship and tried again, I landed and crashed but survived, I have no more fuel or electricity. So I sent an even BIGGER Ship to rescue them, I managed to rescue them, but I realized I wouldn't have enough fuel to take them all back, only enough to get into Kerbin's Orbit. So I attatched seats to the same ship and transfered the Kerbals (Creatures living on Kerbin (Earth)) Back to Kerbin, safe and sound. 11/10Bigger ships always win"

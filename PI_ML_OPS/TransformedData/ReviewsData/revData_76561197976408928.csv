There are heaps of different resources to use, each with different synergies and requirements and trying to manage them all in a way that will satisfy whatever projects your villages are currently trying to complete makes for a different game every time.  You can pause the game at any time to figure out what you're doing, and you need to, there's so much going on in a single game.  Highly recommended if you enjoy giving your brain a workout.  I'm loving it."

However, it's currently unplayable due to the fact that you cannot rebind any keys.  Everytime I try to talk on TS, I throw my shield.  Effectively stunning myself and blowing a cooldown ability every time I try to talk in a cooperative game is extremely frustrating.  Not recommended before rebinding keys is patched in."

It has lived up to all the hype and runs extremely well on a high end system like mine, but can also run reasonably well on a low end system.Ps. Its a Hideo Kojima game."

,"Posted January 21, 2015.","Last edited January 21, 2015.",570,No ratings yet,False,Took me a full 45 min round to discover how to mute people in this game when some 12 year old kid started singing in russian while his parents were litterally screaming at each other in the background. It was the longest three quarters of an hour ive ever had to endure.0/10 - Needs a more conveniently located noob friendly mute button.

Being a goat is like being a god to me and this game made me feel like i was the god of gods, the alpha god. The game story driven gameplay gets you so immursed you feel like the game isn't a game anymore, it becomes reality. A lot happened to me early in 2014, i watched my parents die right in front of my eyes so of course i retreated to video games. Goat Simulator saved my life, after my parents died i became deeply depressed, i was planning to off my self but then i picked up Goat Simulator, and life became beatiful again. In conclusion, all i have to say is: Goats are like dogs, but they're not. Goats also eat cans, so goat CAN do anything; Goat Simulator CAN do anything.10/10"

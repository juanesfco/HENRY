I can stress enough, if you've been craving team-play, realistic gun mechanics and clean graphics, then INSURGENCY is that. It utilizes some mainstream FPS features: suppression, weapon attachments and its own weight system. If Counter-Strike, Day and Defeat and Red Crchestra had 3 way this would be the baby. I've been playing since beta, and the updates are delightful (always progressive and all free), New World interactive has made one of the most polished Indie shooters on the market. The gameplay is intense, butt(_|_) intense. BUY IT, $20 is a bargin!"

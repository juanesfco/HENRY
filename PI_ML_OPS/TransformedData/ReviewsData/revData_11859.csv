,"Posted September 1, 2015.",,365450,No ratings yet,True,"Loved the game, if you are reading the reccomendations to decide if you want it then GET IT! Even a person with no previuos knowledge of computer's or hacking can pla though it may take more time to understand what's going on but once you do its easy from there. But ther game has story, music, theme (backgrounds), jokes, factions, puzzles - sometimes I even had to look up a walkthrough so its not all that easy and it really feels like your hacking rather than playing a game. So many surprises that you wouldn't expect happen and the challenges are immensly satisfying when completed.PortHack/Bit"

The game is boring and very repetitive but the main problem is ur basically watching it. Its like a tv series where u can't do anything. I made a couple extra rooms and when the nest day came they all disapearred and everything that I was supposed to make had been rearranged. Don't buy unless uv'e seen someone play it and tried it, and now want it."

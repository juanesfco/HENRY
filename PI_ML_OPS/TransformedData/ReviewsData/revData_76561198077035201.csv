I picked this up for Christmas last year and I was immediately hooked. Yes there are micro transactions and dlc. But they are both optional. You don't need to buy it. The dlcs add a little more zest to the game. Payday being the steak of the meal and the dlcs being salad and chips, you don't need it but you want it. If you can pick the dlcs up at a time like right now, go for it. Just don't act dumb and buy $50 worth before a sale, I know I did."

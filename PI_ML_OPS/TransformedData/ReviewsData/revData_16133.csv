O.o* also very likely to run into the same team you are playing are in singleplayer and most of the time it'll hate you *of course hate it's self?* game is weird, funny, a little buggy (of course still fairly new game), but all up fun even in single player unlike other 4x stratergy games which get boring in single player quickly. recommend buying it but like all game not perfect but still get it if u like 4x stratergies, and fantasy (but can be a bit anoying when a quest tells u to declare war on an ally T_T luckly ai in this can be forgiving)"

Pros.The story is cool. the characters are interesting . the choices you make matter in the end. a lot of the characters are hot as ♥♥♥♥ (men and women)Con. lots of Quick Time Eventseven though the QTEs happen often it helps you pay attention to the story, it's just something to warn people about if they don't like QTEs 100% reccomend ths game"

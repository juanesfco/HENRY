The only thing the robbers didnt take was my laptop, so i dragged my crusty naked body over to my desk and started playing Terraria again."

Yes this game is hard at first, you will need to put a lot of time into it to truely learn the mechanics and spray patterns. But once you get good and your game sense starts to build, there is no game quite like csgo."

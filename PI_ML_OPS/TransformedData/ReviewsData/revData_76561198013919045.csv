It's got heaps of fun mechanics which keeps the racing interesting, like different weapons/items and the grappling hook, plus all the steam workshop maps and official maps are great. It's not perfect, there are a few glitches and bugs, but there's a good amount of updates that usually ends up fixing these. Also, sometimes I struggle to find a game online, but broadening your search to worldwide should fix it (unless you're internet is rubbish)Highly Recommend, especially if it's on sale (I'd still pay full price though)."

There is some grinding to after around 20 hours into the game howeverGraphics are great considering that it's f2p.Story is wonderful.So about 8/10 from meThere is no harm in trying LOTR0"

This game is going to murder your ability to have patcience, but in the end this game is a little gem, with plenty a ragequits and 'why the hell did I do that moments'.The graphics are very good and fit sound great and most important,  great gameplay is as great as a rebel fighting game thing priate thing810"

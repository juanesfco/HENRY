Demands your attention, and when you give your all you pull things off that make every hour spent in the knowledge that your loss is inevitable worth it.Sure, those hours suck. Play Dota though. It's one of the few gaming experiences out there where there's always something to learn, and when you do learn you share the victory with other real people who appreciate what you've pulled off."

It has it's advantages and disadvantages, but it's not entirely all that bad. Here are my emoti-points.:) Fun storyline:( Big game to download:) Awesome weapons:( Undeveloped Graphics Mostly:) Great Interactivity (whether online or not):( Somethimes cheap void detected (this would be a normal face so maybe :l ):) FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So all in all,  I would probably give a 6.5 out of 10, but compared to other games, if you have Team Fortress 2 and you want a semi-similar genre game, I do recommend you to get this gameGood Day :P"

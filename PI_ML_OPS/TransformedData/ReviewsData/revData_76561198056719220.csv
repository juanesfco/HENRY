Our servers are plagued with foreigners with sky high ping and all they do is team up and kill everyone for no reason. Even if you just respawned. It mainly seems to be asians & Brazilians.Its not racist or anything its the truth. For some reason they all flock to our server not being able to understand a word of english and just kill everyone and horde all items. Single Handely why the game needs so many fixes and wipes. Because its filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.So until they make it people exeeding a ping of 140 can't play on the server & ban all these exploiters and greivers.  I will never rate this game good.

The feel of this game is really good, I really get into it & the graphics and gameplay are all round great. I played without mods for ages and recently downloaded the Radious Total War Mod, I highly recommend it for people who want to add more to the game."

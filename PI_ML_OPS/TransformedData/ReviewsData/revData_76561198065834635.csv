Before long Rome went to the moon, The religion of Steyinsim ( ire-named taoism) was spread to the furthest reaches of France, Naploean went to war with me and wouldn't surrender, Korea hosted the UN, Gandhi threatened to Nuke me because i didn't give him 'crabs,' America was conquered by Russia and Australia was invaded by polynesia...Then once i noticed it had been 2 weeks since i last saw the light of day, i did the responsible thing anybody would do when they haev become addicted to something, i fed the addiction... i downloaded mods...Now Robb Stark was attempting to invade Skyrim, which was being defended by the Jedi Order who were already at war with Batman... Also some random Pirate nation invaded Afirca...20/10, never giving Rio a giant death robot."

I have experienced P3D, FSX and XP 9, 10 and this was just fine. I did not have any fps stutters and no performance issues, or even controller-joystick compatibility issues etc. Sure it's really similar to FSX, well it is literally FSX with a few graphics mods but it has better scenery and optimisation.All in all as much as it wasn't really a step forward I would reccomend this to the noobies new in the Flight Simulator hobby. Once you feel you got the feeling invest in a Joystick or Yoke and buy Flight Simulator X (Original is always better) or  X Planes 9 and 10 (Great Graphics and realism) and if you feel like you wan't to fo further check out Prepar3d (Insane Realism and Graphics). But yeah as previously mentioned this is good for starters not for the main course (That guy who was 10000 hours in FSX lol).Somethings for the developers to consider.Please add graphic revamps and DLCs or Freeware aircrafts etc.6/10 - Great sim for 15 bucks!"

Super Tactical.Good to play with friends as you have people to cry with when you get absolutely dominated by the easy AI.10/10 would cry again.I do have one questions for some AI war veterans.How do I make mark 4 ships? Whenever I try it just says that I have '0 out of 0 in service' and it doesn't let me make any. What is the trick?

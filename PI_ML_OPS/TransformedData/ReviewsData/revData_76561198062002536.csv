You get many class to play as and  there are many fun toys and upgrades to play with. This is a game where teamwork is the key. Run off like a idoit thinking that you will kill a turrent will kill you, but work as a team a turrent can be destoryed without much effort. This is the game best with many friends. But if your a lone (no offence) then you can hook up another keyboard and mouse. AwesomeNauts can have up to THREE players on one computer!!! Three players on one computer. AwseomeNauts don't a have really campain but the muitiplayer is the best. I think is game is really good if you have a friend that own a copy or an extra keyboard and mouse. It rate this game an 8.5 out of 10 stars+ Good muitiplayer+ Adictive+ Many hours of gameplayWritten by Joe10"

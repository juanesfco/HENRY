The story is three bone cousins Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone get seperated from each other and Fone discovers a vally full of crazy creatures. The game is amazing and the charaters in this game are memarable: Like Ted the Bug, The Great red dragon, and the Stupid, Stupid Rat creatures!! I give this game 9/10"

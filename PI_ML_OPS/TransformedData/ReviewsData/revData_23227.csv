Plat Forming is pretty solid, I do recomend you have a freind as it is alot more fun, But you can still have some fun in the Single Player Version. I didnt really see a point to replay game after I completed it. For once the PC version can be played with the KeyBoard, Games like Super Meat Boy Require the Controller but this one is Either way. 8/10 Buy this game :)"

,"Posted February 26, 2015.",,20,0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,"Hear me out i feel if you've never played TF2 you could get used to this game, but if you have played TF2 then you will not enjoy this. I noticed alot of servers werent even full and the ones that were are laggy, not bad laggy but when your fighting its a huge streak the will just freeze everything. I sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like TF2 but different, ALSO if you have played TF2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in TF2. Over all i give this game for people who havent played tf2 a 8/10 but for the ones who have a 5/10. I dont recomend buying this game but if you put alot of time and effort you will master Team Fortress Classic."

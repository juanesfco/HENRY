The game also has a funny MOBA mission mode which i hant seen before. Problem is the servers are only in America (i assume) i am an aussie gamer and i have lag, nothing unlivable with and extreme i just feel like im being shot through walls. besides that it is awsome, the TDM maps are also lame but the otheres are great"

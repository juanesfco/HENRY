The idea of survival is awesome like riding dinos, finding new things to play around with and just doing the hell you want. But there is a downside to this game the fact that you need a pretty good computer that can handle some of the major graphics. Overall good game."

The updates are doing really well on working on the bug fixes. Another good thing is you have guides and funny quotes on items and you character can say something funny. Over all I think this is a great game and would give it 9.5/10

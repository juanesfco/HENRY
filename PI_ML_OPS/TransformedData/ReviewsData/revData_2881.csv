Cons: Opens another window to actually play the game, freezes often in cutscenes and game crashed when i tried to play Online (Last two may just be me though), most things cost gold, which in turn you need to buy for real money, or can be crafted, which requires lots of grinding."

Just sitting here, watching Blu, my plant, grow, while singing to Nail the Snail as he moves along. A great game to calm yourself down, to zen out, or to pass the time with. Water your plants (And your snail) and watch them grow in real time! Name all of your plants (And your Snail (Mine's Called Nail))! Did I mention the steady 60fps?"

Aside from a few glitches that I have come across in the tutorial area, most of which are mostly Graphical, this game is almost perfect!"

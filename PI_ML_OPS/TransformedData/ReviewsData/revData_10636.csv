Finally as of April 13th we are able to get the game. The first thing we all experienced was that the launcher wasn't working for some people and  online wasn't working for everyone until 2hours later.Preloading the game was a pain for people who had installed the game on there SSD, Rockstar why didn't you tell us the game was 120gb when extracted? Seriously...Please add some Oceania servers as us Australian's/ New Zealanders hate connecting to United States servers.. and experiencing bad ping..Other than that I've been playing for 12+ hours now and I am enjoying online."

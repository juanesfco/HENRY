It really does.But it's buggy, the controls are floaty and sometimes don't even respond, and stealth just does not work at all.The music is great, the story is interesting, and the graphics are perfectly fine.But it's the little things, like spelling and grammar errors that make this game look awfully amateurish.This is a game that needs a little bit of an overhaul."

,"Posted July 16, 2012.",,98800,No ratings yet,True,"Ridiculous roguelike, attack scarecrows and bats that taunt you about how bad you are at this game with weapons like softballs, crossbows, axes, and high explosives.Pop culture referneces up the butt. No time for love Doctor Jones.Way too much loot and crafting ♥♥♥♥ to care about, found myself ignoring most items.Still, it's like a dollar.. so it's worth every dollar.Fun game, give it a go."

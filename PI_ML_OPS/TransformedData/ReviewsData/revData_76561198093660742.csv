If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. The best thing about Arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server. One of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is Atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode. I played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game, most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend!"

I have almost played 500 hours of Garry Mod. If you are into building or anything like that, this game is for you. The reason I like this game is about you can almost create anything you can think of and that you can play this game with a mate and get some of the best times out of this game. A gamemode i think everyone should try is DarkRP. DarkRP is a roleplaying gamemode that allows you to take Garry's Mod to the next level such as using Gun, Drugs, Houses, Jobs, Cops, Rebels and just about everything you can think of in real life you can just about do in this game. I got to say if you enjoy Minecraft and it is boring now then this is the next game you should buy and give a go."

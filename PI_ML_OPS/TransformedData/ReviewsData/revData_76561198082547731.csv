I recommend you have a keyboard or GC controller, as it is very much a 'Balls to the walls' racing game. It's a mix between the high speed action of F-Zero and the randomness and questionability of Mario Kart.The game is good and music is great, I play on minimum settings (GEForce 430) and get a good framerate (rarely drops below 75), but the game still looks good, and definitely plays well with a keyboard. I recommend that if you've played F-Zero (or even if you haven't but find it interesting) that you try this game. I picked it up in beta for $4 and even now, at $10, it is worth every cent I reckon.Screenshot of minimum settings[puu.sh]."

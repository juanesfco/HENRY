,"Posted August 14, 2015.",,214950,No ratings yet,True,"I think that steam sells this for FAR. To much money as I can find it in a JB HI-FI for $40 but this game is amazing to me and has only be made better by the Imperator Augustus update.Pros:Can be handled by computers that won't cost $9001I think best morale system in the Total War seriesEach faction has positives and negativesSemi-realisticBeutiful graphix bruhFun DLCsHours of replayability along with plenty of factions to acompany it.Cons:DLCs cost too much or do too little(Kind of included in last point) Greeks are a $15 DLC! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAI cheats obviouslyAI never surrendersSparta can't trade unless they take Athens... Like if you tak Macedonia first you still can't tradeThe Greek and Roman factions have no archers (except Helot archers but they're terrible)Steam sells it for FAR. Too muchRepedative after a whileSpartan morale... Please they're so cool in the movies why did you ahve to make them so bad?I would suggest this game though, unless they reduce the price or there is a steam sale, get it from a store.I must admit that I bought this game when it just came out and costed slightly more than it does now, I also bought 2 of the DLCs BUT I have sinked in a lot of time into this game and I do not regret spending money and seeing this game develope"

,"Posted June 21, 2014.",,72850,No ratings yet,True,"this is an amazing game and the only disbenifits from owning this game is the glitches and how you have to spend money on everything encluding the dlc.I recomend this game to anyone that likes adventuring, killing things, absoving a dragons soul, pickpocketing and casting weird dangerous spells."

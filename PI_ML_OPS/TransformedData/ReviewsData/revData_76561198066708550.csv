I could happily say that this game is one of the most beautiful, and enticing games that I have ever played. The visuals are beautiful as well as the story line which has the potential to pull you right in from the moment you start playing."

Gone Home is a short interactive story game with an absolutely beautiful story. If you like games with a great story and games that will keep you thinking for hours after you play this is a game you should buy."

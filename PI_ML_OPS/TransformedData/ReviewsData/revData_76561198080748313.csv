,"Posted December 21, 2013.","Last edited December 21, 2013.",221100,No ratings yet,True,"Dayz standalone is a great game,  you can't find the experience anywhere else. It has bugs but there is no game breaking bugs. You won't broke your leg going into a building :) anymore. BTW once you buy the alpha you will get the whole game and all the updates. So $30.00 is pretty good.+Great map and many improvements+Great Feel+Lots of improvement over the dayz mod-bugs-feels kind of clunky going through buildingsDont forget this is an alpha.One time i ate a rotten kiwi because i was really hungry and about a hour later i was armed to the teeth with the best gear. I was about to die from the kiwi and then a guy shot me :( But remember don't trust anyone at all....."

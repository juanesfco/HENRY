I dont know why people would spam this with negative reviews. Just do research on the requirements before you purchase a game .... the negative reviews are from duds with ancient pc's who dont do research before they buy....  and theres always  that refund option so why not give it a test?gameplay is great, graphics are on point and it stays true to a total war game but with a fresh twist. Co op and multiplayer work nicely so grab a friend and try it out! I recommend this to anyone into RTS and that have an average or decent PC,  youll have a great time.  my specs : graphics - geforce gtx 750 tiCpu - Intel core i7 920@2.67Ram - 8 gigs DDR3HDD - 2 TOS - Windows  7 ^ pretty old but it does the job "

I got a refund and had to go back to xbone just cause the connection is way better and i cant just stop playing this its way to addictive haha. Overall if you dont mind ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ping and lag then go for it but with a game like this connection is usually a major part :/ gameplay 1010graphics 1010connection -900010"

In Far Cry 3 you can hunt, craft, explore, discover and loot as well as shooting bad guys in the face, either using a range of different stealth tatics and weapons, or running and gunning using big guns. I would reccommend Far Cry 3 to anyone who likes a whole range of excellent experiences."

The sheer size of the game, and how many ways you can play it, overwhelms your mind. The Shooter-looter aspect of this game is probably the best shooter-looter aspect in any game that is currently out. I love Borderlands 2 and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent experince. I'm looking foward to what Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel holds for the community."

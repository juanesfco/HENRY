,Posted January 1.,,265630,5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful,False,Fistful fraqs is a old westurn FPS running on the Half Life 2 engine with a small diverse range of weapons to choose ffrom and with varios gamemodes.The first few hours of gameplay was actually quite amusing and fun to play but that did not last long and got boring quite quickly. So I really wouldnt waste download data on this one. I give this 4.5/10 1ups
,"Posted November 25, 2015.",,417860,No ratings yet,True,I think this is a great game for people who just want to escape the real world and become part of a story/ a scripted relationship. This reminds me of those old text based games on the old MS-DOS computers.I give this game 8/10 stars

Then, when you go higher and higher through the tiers, you look at things differently. 'I must build a better robot to kill the other robot!' you think to yourself. But then, you realise that there is only one good robot shape. The gunbed. Soon, the game loses the charm it once had in tiers 1-3. You no longer see a giant white ♥♥♥♥♥ or a ridiculously large tower. It gets worse. I spent $5 on this game. Then, I was so overpowered, I didn't feel like playing anymore. It's too easy once you buy premium. So, I do recommend this game, but it is only to be enjoyed for a short while. Soon, it will get boring."

Despite the large P2W themes, I believe that you can easily earn your way up, with a small amount of panicked grinding. Even the grinding is frantic, as once you die, YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.Both pleasure and pain, I highly reccomend this game."

YOu can choose either to play it fast or play it slow, sneaking around with a cricket bat or blasting heads off with a grenade launcher. Even though I've spent less than 100 hours on this, it's still in my favourite top 4 games on Steam. If you are getting Steam, this is one game you must get."

If you have completed BL2, I still don't think this game is worth buying UNLESS it is discounted for 70%+. In my first playthrough, I got less than 15-20 hours with some sidequests, yet in BL2 u get twice as much (but nothing compares to BL2). The gameplay itself feels no different to BL2, despite the new mechanic of the 'Butt-slam' and low-grav. You never really find yourself running out of O2 and the Butt-slam is worthless. You may as well be trying to kill people with Zer0's unforseen if you want to use this mechanic lethally.Pros:-New weapon type (it's exciting until you actually try it and you're like....oh....)-New element-New characters (Claptrap!)-Finally we get the Moon dlc we've always wantedCons:-Short as ♥♥♥♥-Reused models (probably the biggest part of this game after completion besides replaying is hunting down uniques)-None of the new features (low-grav, cryo, lazers) are actually good, they're just enticing-Raid-boss mission after the main story is just the last boss again (laziness)-Barely any areas (although most are pretty big, around Wildlife Exploitation size)-Character to character interactivity is crappy (maybe Claptrap is an exception)I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all unless it was on sale."

High doesnt even work unless you have the developer´s machine or tons of money put into your set up.Gameplaywise its like Ratchet & Clank cutscenes with basic MMO features, i´d suggest you to get on the WoW train now when Legion´s out, Wildstar isnt as big or finished as they wanted it to be"

,Posted September 17.,,444090,No ratings yet,True,"Team FPS MOBAs are hugely trendy this season and much like Battleborn and Overwatch, Paladins is definetly a name to watch out for. It´s free, it´s fun, the graphics look great, they got that Pixar vibe in the overall artstyle and gameplay just works and is the kind of ♥♥♥♥ i´d consider buying a new PC for coz you want that 60 FPS upPros = Free, creative teamplay, tons of skins to customize with, fast games (really great if you´re a working class man and busy with little sparetime to drop on gaming)Cons = Still needs to go a long way to not be overshadowed by Overwatch especially since a lot of the features feel the same from ultimates to characters and gameplay. What needs to change = More heroes, more maps, more skins and a big advertisement campaign. Other than that this gets the green light from me. As a gamer since 1999, i´d recommend this to newbies and serious gamers alike. It´s fun."

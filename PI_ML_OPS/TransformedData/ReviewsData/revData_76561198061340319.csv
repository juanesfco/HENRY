,"Posted July 27, 2014.",,304930,3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"First off, I believe this game has potential. A lot of it.When I started, there was nothing more fun than crawling around in abandoned villages with wrecked cars, trying to obtain meagre supplies.That being said, I feel that multiplayer wasn't the best experience for me. Especially with LAN, if I wanted to play with a family member, it is excruciatingly hard to try to bump into each other for some actual 'co-op' play the creators wanted. Perhaps with LAN, there could be an option to spawn next to a player?Multiplayer was alright, but again, the vast maps meant it was hard to actually meet anyone/form alliances/etc, and it felt exactly the same as single player, except for the abnormally large chat text filling up my screen.That being said, I still believe this game does, and will, live up to its potential, and I will be following this game closely.tl;dr: if you just want to hope into a game by yourself to play, this is 100% what you want. Want to play with mates over LAN? Good luck with that."

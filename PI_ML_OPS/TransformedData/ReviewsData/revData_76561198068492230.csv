Hook up with your buddies and begin to explore the vast world of Trove, If you like customization and feeling unique in an open world adventure game, with crafting and building you`ll feel right at home. I havnt played the game enough to give it a full review yet, but for a free to play game its simply awesome. Weather your exploring the wilderness or creating your own homestead theres tons of content to get your hands stuck into.It seem the creators really gave this game a lot of attention and time. Give it a blast you wont be disapointed after all its free and doesnt take up much memory on your hdd."

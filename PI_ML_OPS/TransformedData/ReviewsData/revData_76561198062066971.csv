There are so many fun gamemodes on Multiplayer, with many dedicated servers to be found. The Singleplayer shows the full potential of the game, with scenarios which allow people to make their own missions and share them on steam workshop, and also the fantastic campaign called 'Survival'.ArmA 3 is a great game for casual and serious gamers."

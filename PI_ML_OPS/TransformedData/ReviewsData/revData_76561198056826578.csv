Missions that make you Zzz and horrible end game. S A D A G E N T S.

I learnt how to nep a nep, how to search dungeons for hours looking for new dungeon plans and how to grind on polytans to get everyone to max level. Most importantly I dissapointed my friends and family even further.Ps- Blanc best girl"

It has a rich story and I'm definetly buying the rest in the series when (and if) they come out!"

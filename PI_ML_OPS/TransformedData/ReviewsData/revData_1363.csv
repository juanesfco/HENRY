,"Posted September 10, 2014.",,1840,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Source Filmmaker is a tool that valve uses to make all the trailers for the games unless they use another animatior engine which I doubt.Anyway at the start of the Software i will admit it was like buttons and the word no map loaded every time I played it it was so confusing. When I see other people videos on Youtube i start to be frustrated on how they learnt it. But then I looked on the tutorials Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2B46DEB4157E67C4 that helped me out very much i was able to make a profile picture and other pictures but even though when you make a video and it doesnt look like other ones dont give up on  it because you will improve

,"Posted April 28, 2015.",,241540,No ratings yet,True,I played this game for a while and i thought when i switched to PC that i would't have to deal with this Year one redone ♥♥♥♥. So it is disappointing that they (Undead Labs)  only offer a 33% discount and not a full upgrade to those of Us who payed for this version expecting to be valued as a community and to see Undead Labs. Releasing basically a graphical update and calling it a 'Year One' version of this game is the wrong direction for this Studio.

It has not only slow walking zombies, but it also has a few runners too4. lots of weapons to choose from5. Amno is scarce, which makes it challenge, plus it makes the game a lot more realistic6. A lot of things can kill you like getting whacked by a zombie, getting infected, falling, etcAlthough the graphics are kinda old lookin, and the game doesnt have  a lot of maps, id still give it a 7.5/10."

With its consistent updates, It's awesome Community and good old HATS! Team Fortress 2 gives you what most First Person Shooters can't give you anymore, hilarious fun without the pressure of 'doing well'. Honestly if your on steam and havn't played Team Fortress 2 yet. What's wrong with you?ayy lmao guys play comp tf2 (6v6 or 9v9) it's actually so much better then the rest of the game."

,"Posted July 5, 2012.",,207250,No ratings yet,True,"Oh man, great indie for only $2 WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Seriously though , there's a tower defence game mode and a versus mode that's really fun but what you really want this for is the multiplayer. Heck get it with a friend and you're only paying $1.60 each. That's two potato cakes or a really good game your choice really."
,"Posted May 17, 2012.",,55040,No ratings yet,True,"It doesn't look like much, but the simple graphics hide a really good zombie-survival strategy game with an on-going campaign where every decision you make actually has long term effects. You are an evacuation manager who has to co-ordinate the evacuation of civilians and (hopefully) the eradication of zombies. If you like Indie games and/or enjoy strategy/management, this is worth it."

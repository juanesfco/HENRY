It feels like more effort is being put into learning how to read music a la guitar hero than being put into learning the songs themselves, and for what? Sure, if you're a complete beginner and like how easy it is to get into then maybe, but otherwise just buy a book and learn."

The game can be very drawn out and more like a sandbox if you play it that way. The co-op definately compliments this. It's always better with co-op, ideally with a group of trusted players, all in the same room that have 48 hrs (for the completionist) or less to kill."

Gimme a hand!' the game will be ruined forever. As it is so far, it's really fun to play alone and also with friends."

I was looking forward to DKIII, but this will be the sequel DKII never had. I am aware that it is still very much a work in progress, but even at 'fastest' setting the game will be unplayably laggy due to the large amount of things it has to load and animate at any given time (maybe convert offscreen models into sprites?)."

,"Posted June 27, 2014.",,203650,No ratings yet,True,"This game is pretty awesome. It's challenging enough to not bore you to death, and the varied level design is welcomed. The multiplayer component is also very fun (especially on the tornado levels). The only nitpicks that I really have with the game are its fairly short length and graphics (then again, no one really judges how good a game is solely based off its graphics).7/10"

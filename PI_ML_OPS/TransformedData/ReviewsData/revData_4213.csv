Steal a key from a guard to make your escape, and your magically caught when he wakes up. Drop some dirt on the ground, you're caught. It gets frustrating especially when it takes so long to prepare yourself for an escape, and while this can be a great game when it works, when it doesn't you just feel cheated."

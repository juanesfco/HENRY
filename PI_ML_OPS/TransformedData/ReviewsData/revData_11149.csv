Why on earth would anyone want to pay good money for 2/3 of a story? It makes no sense. Warner Bros should be ashamed of themselves, tricking people into paying for a product on the promise that it will be finished later, only to back out of it later on. STEAM should be more honest and label this game as a 'EARLY ACCESS'."

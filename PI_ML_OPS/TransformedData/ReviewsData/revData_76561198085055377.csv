Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself."

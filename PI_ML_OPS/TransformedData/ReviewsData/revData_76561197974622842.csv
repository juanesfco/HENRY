,"Posted July 12, 2011.",,35480,No ratings yet,True,Charming game packed full of content and replayability.  At $10 it is amazing value.  Three thumbs up (don't ask.)
,"Posted July 3, 2011.",,41500,No ratings yet,True,"Indie Steam-Punk Diablo clone ?  Theres nothing in that sentence I don't like.  If you like your plots thin and your gameplay 100% 'kill everything that moves', you could go a lot worse than Torchlight.."

,"Posted December 31, 2010.","Last edited August 12, 2014.",32370,No ratings yet,True,"A classic Bioware game.  I like to think of KOTOR as Baldur's Gate 3 in Star Wars drag.  Simplified yes, but a lot of downtime that added nothing to the overall experience has been removed as well.Fast paced highly enjoyable game with a good story and interesting characters.  I wish they had made a movie of this game instead of the sad episode 1 to 3 we got instead."

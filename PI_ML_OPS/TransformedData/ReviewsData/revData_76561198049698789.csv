The game is Best played with friends.With a keyboard and mouse, I found it a bit dodgy (sometimes slow between when I press a button to actually doing something on screen), with a controller however (I used some software that let me use my ps3 controller on my PC) it was fine, with no lag, just as if I was playing it on a console. Good stuff!"

Imagine if csgo or tf2 required you to upgrade your awp to make it a dakdak, or have a rocketlauncher that did far more damage than any other because you had played the game longer.Ontop of the fact that a fully upgraded sniper rifle takes AGES to kill and is super ♥♥♥♥.But that kinda makes my main point irrelevant.Whatever.This game is free, so its not like your gunna have to make some sort of investment but i wouldnt reccommend.4/10"

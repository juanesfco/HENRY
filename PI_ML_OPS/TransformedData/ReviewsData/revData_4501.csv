Every single player featured (HyHy, FEAR and Dendi) devoted their time, made sacrafices and worked hard to achieve their ultimate (press R) goals. Especially touching is the clip of fishing at the end. I need not say more should you have already seen this."

Also do not play if you like opening crates. This game has crates."

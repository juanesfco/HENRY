,"Posted June 6, 2015.","Last edited June 6, 2015.",333930,No ratings yet,True,"(At time of review i've played 6hrs and lvl 5)So far this game is fun, it offers fun kinda tactical gamplay and the 3 loadout/class system is a great addition to class based shooters. I would recommend getting it's a 9/10 from me just because the rhino class is unbalanced and the maps sometimes have to many bottlenecks.P.S You can run around and kill people with  cricket bats, it's fun smashing in someones skull with a cricket bat"

,"Posted August 30, 2014.",,301520,No ratings yet,True,It's a fun creative game with a spin on the alternative arena deathmatch. The large amount of possiblities make this game very enjoyable. At times it can be a bit grindy and doesn't have much in the way of a tutorial but it works in the end just use the internet. 9/10 :)

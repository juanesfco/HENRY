,"Posted November 15, 2015.",,336380,5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,"The interface and controls of this game put me off entirely.You can't customize the controls and the defaults have the camera controled by the keyboard and movement controlled by the mouse, which is completely opposite to the way that I find comfortable.People keep telling you to go to places, like they expect you know the area, but having just started the game and there not being a minimap or anything to give you directions, that became really annoying really quickly."

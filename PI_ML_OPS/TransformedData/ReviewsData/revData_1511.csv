I'd equate Normal difficulty Alien:Isolation to Normal in FTL (ie already more than hard enough). Take your time when playing, read everything you can get your hands on and just get sucked into the world. They've done an amazing job creating atmosphere, so don't rush through the game.  Enjoy the journey (and your shrill screams every time the alien jumps you)."

,"Posted January 8, 2014.",,234330,No ratings yet,True,"Great game, lots of fun. Recommend when you first start you concentrate on leveling up good guys. You may get the opportunity to get Daken (Wolverines son) and a couple other of the Dark Avengers, but i wouldn't invest too much iso on them at the start. Most of your early boss battles will be against Dark Avengers, so you'll find your best heroes aren't available in major fights if you've leveled up Dark Avengers.If you're going to spend some cash recommend utilising the daily deals and concentrating on the 2 star and up good guys for leveling.Whilst leveling up 1 star Storm, Iron Man and Black Widow might seem a good decision at the start, if you're planning to play long term I wouldn't wate too much iso on them. They're level capped to 50 (from memory) and are quickly outgunned by the 2, 3 and 4 star heroes."

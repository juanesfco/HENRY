Only thing I liked about this Call of Duty was the single player campaign, the story isn`t great but it`s alright. The quick button or move moments are really cool and just bad ♥♥♥ I will admit. The villian honestly feels like an alternitive universe Makarov. I had some fun playing this game, yes it has it`s flaws and the PC port isn`t the best as well.... Motion Blur being only turned on when you hold down the knife button and it turns off when you let go of the knife button, even though I have Motion Blur turned on in the settings, there are fixs to this game but I see the PC community dosn`t really give a rats ♥♥♥ about this game and I don`t blame them. As usual the graphics look mostly the same but on maxed out it looks quite good.Conclusion, an alright game 6/10 Would of been a 7 if the PC port was actually good."

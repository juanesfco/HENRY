,"Posted January 3, 2014.",,49520,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Borderlands 2 is an awesome addition to the borderlands games.  There is so much to do i highly reccomend getting the goty edition. Great value for money. Only downside is the dlc's are very short nothing like the borderlands 1.

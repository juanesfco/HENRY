This RTS game is based before the events of the 1st Homeworld game and is based on land in a desert (obversely). It has great art style, the sound is great, the acting is amazing and the story is as good as you would expect for a Homeworld game. My only downplay is you cannot key bind your controls.. yetI recommand this game to all Homeworld fans and those who love Sci-Fi RTS games. Its a must buy."

I played this when it was released in 1999 and now played it again in 2015. The magic is still there. Amazing visuals, Amazing Story, Amazing Gameplay, Amazing Sound Track etc.This is up there with the likes of Half-Life for me. If you havnt played it and you like RTS i suggest you try this out. For its going price plus the classic versions included you wont be disapointed."

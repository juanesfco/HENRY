The people in the game have a different language like in the Sims but this makes you focus more on the game and you can still understand the people through body language and expressions. The story is great and I can't wait to finish this one :DHas controller support too! ^_^

Multiplayer rocks as well |m/Still in beta but it's pretty good and enjoyable :DDD"

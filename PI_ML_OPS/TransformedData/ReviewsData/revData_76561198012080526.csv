,"Posted September 29, 2015.",,290770,3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful,True,"This game has proven to me that not only a deserted facility with hostile entities can hold such hold a much deeper and dark history to it. The atmosphere of the game is extremely eerie from the player's perspective.The gameplay focuses on - complicated puzzles- Intense action- On a linear platformMiscellaneous Information:Voice acting - for the game puts the player into the perspective of the protagonist in the Mark 7 A.R.I.D combat suit. Interesting language between the artificial intelligences, very complicated sentences but yet understanding (makes you feels smart haha)Combat - gameplay is very simple but yet very entertaining by stretching out into: range actions and CQC.Enviroment - was proven to feel very empty and dead for a long period of time. Walking through vents and hallways filled with filthy organic matter makes the player feel that they are entering a working facility that was once filled with people and noises which is then turned in dead silence.

It involves a lot skill to achieve awesome victories and accept brutal defeats. A lot of team is involved in this game especially towards the hunters.Throughout mid level players you will find people who are born into the game and those who seen the character before.Trust meAt high rank players, eveyone know their roles by then, hopefully.By then, it's starts getting fun by thenCons are - takes a while to start getting to the 'good bit' of this game                - and also, the dlc's are too expensive."

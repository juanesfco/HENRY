Levels dont seem very balanced as some require you to sell/build to mess with the pathing of the attackers.Game seems like a bad console port and as I was on my last 2 achievements the game crashed and reset my progress.

Misses seem to happen far to often.If the Devs did some work fixing the bugs in this game it would be great but considering these large bugs nearly a year after release I would suggest not buying it unless you only want it for the multiplayer."

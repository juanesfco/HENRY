It picks up right after the ending to Half Life 2, and that's all I'll say without spoiling too much. The story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this. The gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety. It was pretty much like 'Go into a new area. Clear out area. Repeat.' The game is very short, but I consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay. However, if you loved Half Life 2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons."

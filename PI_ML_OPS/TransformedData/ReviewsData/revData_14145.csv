,"Posted February 26, 2015.",,239140,3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful,True,"The story was predictable, side quests were mediocre and the final boss was a Vaas wannabe that was simply awful (it was the worst QTE that I've seen in years).And yet I've loved it! It soaked me for 31 hours and I know I'll be returning to this game. Combat is satisfying, parkour in my opinion was even better than in Mirror's Edge and the atmosphere! The first 10 hours of the game were incredibly tense and the first night was simply terrifying!Pick it up, trust me. I don't like Dead Island, I'm not really interested in zombie games but this one was worth every penny."

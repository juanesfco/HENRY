Clearly your use of 2K australia to produce to the produce the game while you develope Battleborn is a scam to steal my money. DLC is what makes Borderlands games what they are. Are you telling me that this piece of BS is good DLC? Are out of your freaking mind? Rather than waste time building arenas, why don't you actually make another story and add some much needed weaponry. oh And do not give to 2K Australlia. they already took all the funny humor out of Borderlands. You really don't need them.yours truly,Skitz"

In terms of gameplay its just like a normal FPS, but its better because of the variety in weapons and in specail skills. While my favorite is the gunzerker, which can dual wield weapons, Other specails include turning invisible, trapping people in inescapable aurasphere thing, and summoning turrets are all extremely diverse and compelling abilities. 10/10 by far"

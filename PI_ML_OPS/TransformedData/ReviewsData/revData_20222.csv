I suggest playing with other people to have maximum quality and see how much creativeness your mind can withhold.If you are really creative you can create your own gamemode or even your own map, it depends on your hearts desire on what you want to do in this game! Create battles, create buildings or plain sillyness. As long as your having fun on the game.BTW the first thing i saw on a sandbox server was player models doing a pose. so yea, its a great game!"

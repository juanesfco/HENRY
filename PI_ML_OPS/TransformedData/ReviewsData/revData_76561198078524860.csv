Only because it is in 'BETA Stage'. I have to admit, this is a nice game that you could play for a few hours then you have to restart because you either 1. Think your guy is too overpowered. Or 2. Want to see what other worlds have in-store for you. I give it a 6/10. Only because it is still in 'BETA Stage'. But it still is pretty good."

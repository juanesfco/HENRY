You have the sword guy(who is a tank), a dude witha gun (who shoots good), a nice pair of breasts  and a nice ♥♥♥ with a magic stick (she heals), and a nice pair of breasts and a nice ♥♥♥ with claws(she does... stuff(?)).The aim of the game is to try and collect crystals to help your empire, or at least thats what they would have you believe. The real aim of the game is to find the best weapon for each person, gun guy automatically starts off with a rad gun that shoots through enemies with high damage, healing breasts gets her cool staff mid way through the game, it does the same as gun guys weapon(shoots through enemies, high damage, high crit), claw lady gets her good weapon early on when you visit her tribe of furries and retrieve their bad dragon order from a temple. sword guys stuff is all kinda okay, just use him to tank damage.The game looks pretty rad, apart from all the cutscenes, which for some reason look kinda pixelated and rubbish. Sometimes you get some cutscenes that aren't the prescripted ones and the AI will walk in  dumb positions . Butt that doesn't matter too much.The combat system is rather cool and needs skill and timing to get combos rather than mashing buttons, then again in combat all I ever did was 'X, X, A, > A, A, X' which had a nice continous loop for juggling enemies.All out this game is pretty good for something originally released on the ORIGINAL xbox. I rate it 10/10 it's okay."

,"Posted August 21, 2015.",,364323,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,I find this plane a joy to fly. I have not noticed any bugs so far and the auto-pilot isn't overly complex. It would be nice if the dials were able to be scrolled both ways on each side of them and the alitude knob is extemely difficult to adjust in hundreds of feet instead of thousands. Aside from this I have thoroughly enjoyed flying this aircraft and the textures look great on a mid-high spec desktop. Not sure if it's worth 25 USD but I hapily paid the 15 or so that it was while it was on sale.

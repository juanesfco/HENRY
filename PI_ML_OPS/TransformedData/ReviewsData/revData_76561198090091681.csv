,"Posted January 18, 2014.",,221100,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,for people that keep saying this game is ♥♥♥♥ and has less content its becasue its alpha of course its got les content ut im mean n a way its got more terms of survial items and others dis it because they either ♥♥♥♥ at the game or just are stupid 12 year olds that KOS i mean get ♥♥♥♥ed if your gonna shoot on sight go play COD again. i have a good pc and if you want to test if your computer can run it try playing crysis 2 or 3 not an ugly looking game like farcry ut i love the game put many hours into the mod ut doesnt show in steam becasue it wasnt linked to steam i put out 500 hours into it and am loving the standalone and i recommened this game if your not a Cod player and have a good pc ut my friends pc which isnt very good can handel it with 25 - 30 fps so buy if you want buy now bacause its gonna go up in price so $30 IS VERY GOOD

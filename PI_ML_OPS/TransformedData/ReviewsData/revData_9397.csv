The game ozzes with charm. The controls are tight and responsive, which you'll need as you more often than not you'll only win by narrowly escaping death.Nothing is more enjoyable than throwing a land mine through a teleporter and killing someone on the otherside."

As you get better your goals will look more and more epic. The first time you boost way up into the air and score a goal will surely have you fist pumpming and giving yourself the congratulations you clearly deserve.The Music is also a worthy mention as sitting in the menu customizing one of the many rocket powered cars will have you amped up and ready to play.In the short time I have had this game it has been updated often with new content and has offered some cheap DLC's as well.(You can drive DeLorean!!!!)If you are even the slightest bit curious in this game I highly recommend getting it. Chances are you will love it the moment you get to the main menu."

He for some reason can't just close a door either, no no he must slam that sh8t out of any door you try to close. Then there is the sounds of his breathing which I understand are meant to be him being in a state of panic but it just sounds like he is having a heart attack to me.I just can't help but think that if I was in this situation I would be trying to be as quiet as I can as I snoop around a bloody horror scene, not slamming doors!As I have already said I know this is picky but f8ck me I wish my caharacter would just try to be quiet."

It's a fantastic way to create, animate and render a piece of work, without requiring additional software in order to animate, render etc. The Graph editor is an amazing tool for amateur animators and the sheer number of cinematographic options given to you with the ridiculously malleable lighting and particle engines are immense. The program, once you get over the rather steep learning curve, is really easy to use and has the potential to create some seriously professional-looking pieces of work.If you want to see just what this program can do, I would recommend checking out any of the 'Meet the Team' videos and the winners of the 2013 Saxxy Awards. They can express just how amazing this piece of software is better than any review my sleep-deprived mind could write.tl;dr: 10/10 would dedicate the rest of my existence to."

Firewatch continued to pull me in with an intriguing mystery and a well-built sense of unease. And then Firewatch, in its final hours, sat me down in a wooden chair in a dark room, and sadistically tore up all the clues, all the conspiracy theories and all the interesting story elements in front of me, before rubbing a copy of Gone Home in my face and rolling the credits while innocently playing the ukelele.Wait for a sale."

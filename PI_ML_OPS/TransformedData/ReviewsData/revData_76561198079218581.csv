,"Posted March 14, 2013.",,4920,No ratings yet,True,"A really great FPS/RTS mix done right, including tons of options to go by, tons of customization via mods on the workshop, and a real feeling of support from the developers towards a competitive community. For everyone who was disapointed by Aliens Colonial Marines, this game more than makes up for it."

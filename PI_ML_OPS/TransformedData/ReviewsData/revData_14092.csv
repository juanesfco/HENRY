It takes a lot of time and money to develop a game, especially an open world one, and this is were early access can really work. Committed developers, active community and early access to help fund it all. Now we're here at 1.0 and Starbound has become vastly fatter campared to Its bare bones early builds. Dont come looking for me, I'll be busy."

Awesome shooter game to play either by yourself or Co Op. always interesting missions and I'm so hooked on the game that small cut scenes got me right in the feels."

I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow"

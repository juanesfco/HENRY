Widescreen support, bugs fixed, gameplay changes, runs better, Steam multiplayer support, Steam mod support, achievements, steam trading cards, the list goes on and on. And for the devs to release it for free to anyone who owned Titan Quest on Steam is even better.Kudos to THQ Nordic for a job well done, you've made a long time fan and someone who still played your game today even happier with your product. Take note devs, this is how you make people love your company."

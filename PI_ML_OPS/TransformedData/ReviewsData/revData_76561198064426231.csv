The game doesn't have a official host so players must host the matches and that is quiet terrible since some players don't have good conexions to host it. You can quit a match whenever you want without punishment which I think it is a problem that the creators must solve as fast as they can. I'll not recomend the game since those two issues are quiet bad for an online game. But if you don't mind for lag players or rage quit I can say for sure you will have some fun playing it.ps: sorry for my bad english."

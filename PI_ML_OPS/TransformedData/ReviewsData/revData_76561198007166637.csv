The creatures stop doing their tasks sometimes and I have no idea why. Need some sort of idicator as to why it's not working. I realise sometimes they can't reach but it's not clear enough. Overall it feels unresponsive. I think the UX, character feedback and responsiveness is a key issue and will make or break whether i continue to play this game."

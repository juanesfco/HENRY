I WANT MORE!!!The story mode is only 3 hours long at a slow pace. The shorts at an absolute most are 1 hour. Developers, please make more shorts/dlc or even a new octodad. I would happily pay an extra 10USD for 5 extra shorts. I loved the game but I was sad when I completed it, I want more!!!"

The difficulty of the stages progress at the same pace as your ability and there are very few levels I find too easy or too difficult. If you have $5 in your steam account, I recommend you prioritise this game over any other item of the same price."

Flawless mechanics, skills, itemisation. This is A-RPG done right. Download and share it around, game-folder can be copy-pasted, accounts are Free. Runs on old intel integrated chips (Intel GMA4500 MHD - laptop) quite well. It's the 9th Most Played Game on Steam at the moment ... why? Because +5 Awesomeness of dynamic content-placement algorithms make your bearded Templar's improved silicon nipples into seamless distributors of loot-dropping gnarliness, that's why!"

You are Henry, a man who, once you start playing, will discover has issues he is trying to deal with, how does he deal with them?, by taking a job as a fire lookout in a quiet tower in Shoshone National Park all alone...... except for the voice on the other end of his walkie talkie. Visuals - SolidBackground Audio - Extremely fittingDialogue - Well written and actedPlaytime - 3 Hours with minor rushingThemes - Suprisingly well thought throughTo leave a small note, this is a rather elegant debut game by Campo Santo and while many say the play time doesnt justify the price tag, My opinion is that they have done extremely well creating a game that is both thought provoking and different. I look forward to their next offering in the video game world.Kudos to you, Campo Santo"

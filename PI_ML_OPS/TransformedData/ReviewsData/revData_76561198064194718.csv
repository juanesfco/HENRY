This game can be frustrating but I can't stop. It's addictive, violent and if you're playing it in the same room as someone, they're going to tell you to stop yelling because it will make you rage...unless you're super pro or chill as ♥♥♥♥ but most of all, it's fun. I recommend it to anyone. It's a shame Hotline Miami 2 is banned here in Australia."

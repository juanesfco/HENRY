It was a symbolism of life. It shows how as you get older the way you view life changes, not the world around you. This game really makes you stop and think about your own life. The music was beautiful and the game play was great. It is short, effective game and one that i will definitely  play more than once. In the five minutes that i played this game, I had more feelings come to me than a lot of other movies and games. This is a truly magnificent piece of artwork. Not just a game, but a piece of truly beautiful artwork. There are no words I can use to describe how I felt playing this game. Play this game and think about yourself and how you view the world around you. You will not regret it, and you might even find it will open your eyes."

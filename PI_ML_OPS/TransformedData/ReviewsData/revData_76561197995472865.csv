I found Guerilla to give me more entertainment since it was open world and the destruction you caused wasn't limited to a level. However, Armageddon still gave me a solid 8-10 hours gameplay offline, which only included the campaign, a few infestation levels and about an hour mucking about in free roam. I have not tried Online and there are plenty more things to do in offline mode (achievements, secrets, harder difficulties, etc.) Graphics wise the game was OK. I was playing the game off a new-ish laptop and everything ran fine, however I don't think graphics are on par with games that came out around the same time. But hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?I definitely recommend this game to any one looking for intense FPS destruction game. I payed $5 when it was on sale, however I think the original price of $20 is worth it, especially if you can get some friends in on it. Rating: 7/10"

For now, I don't recommend it. Why? Because it doesn't have enough content yet (in my opinion). I've been playing Space Engineers (made by the same people) and it has plenty of things to do and see, while, for the similar price of $20, Medieval Engineers just doesn't quite have enough to warrant the price tag.Yes I know it is Early Access, and the base building is absolutely awesome, but I found myself playing for about 20 minutes and then getting bored. I will definitely change this review in the future when more content is added and when multiplayer is added. I regret buying it at this stage (21/02/2015)."

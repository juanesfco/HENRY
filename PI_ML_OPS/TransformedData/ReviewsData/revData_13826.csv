Jazzpunk attempts a stone black, immature yet incredibly witty style of comedy, rarely explored in games and succeds beautifuly. Took about 4 hours to complete but still worth the price, purely from a narrative point of view. Not to mention the fantastic sound design and stylish aesthetic that only help to serve the hilarity.4 Stars"

This mod perfectly updates the original without sacrificing anything, allowing this classic experience to be brought to a whole new generation of gamers, while retaining everything long term fans adore. A wonderful way to keep DX alive, and so very respectful and reverential to the original. Amazing work -- I'm addicted."

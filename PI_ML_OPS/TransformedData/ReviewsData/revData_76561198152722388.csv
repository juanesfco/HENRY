The only problem I have is the batmobile. Why do you, Rocksteady, think it is ok for half of the game to be based in a need for speed with guns chase? It doesn't make sense. Just make it how it was in Arkham City, that was a better version of this game. Overall, Rocksteady, next time have your original team working on the port and don't make half the game a car game with 'friendly' as they call it, guns.6.5/10 - Buy it for a cheap prices if you want the game. The port is better, but it still is a car game."

As soon as I played it, I sunk 2 hours into this game. It has very simple controls and is very addictive. The graphics are actually quite good. Overall, if you want to just click, click and click, get this game as it is for free!Though it is simple, it will get you addicted like Crack, its just an easy solution.7/5/10- Jarps"

It suits it all perfectly.And it is one of those games where the sadness you feel when a character you love dies grows the second time, not dilutes.I cannot give this game a high enough rating, buy it, look past the hype and enjoy it."

But only if you like the genre.Get Unturned instead, its free and is much more fun."

The community is good and you can see your feet! I would give this game 11/10 You have to put hours in to be good at the game and unlock things (I guess you could say its a bit of a grind)but its so rewarding when you get the good weapons. Its also easy to get XP by doing the right things in the game. The graphics arn't the greatest but still you are still able to deal with them."

The games that good that everyone who has owned the game for a year or two has over 100 hours on it. This game is really that good. If there is doubt in your mind as to if you should buy Gmod, get rid of it now! It only costs $9.99 and when there is sales it costs like $3!Just stop reading my review and buy it already!"

,"Posted August 17, 2015.",,252950,No ratings yet,True,This is a really fun good game that is worth getting fot the price of it. A great feature is being able to connect your Xbox One controller or Play Station controller up to your PC and being able to use it to play this game. I also really like being able to play with people on PS4 while playing on PC.I'm sure you'll really enjoy this game and I would highly recommend it

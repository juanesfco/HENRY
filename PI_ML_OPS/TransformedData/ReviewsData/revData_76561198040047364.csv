Extremely Immersive, The best story in any MMO, periodThe cutscene and voice acting is top notch, and each and every quest is accompanied by cutscenes. Combat is fun and mobile, actually requires you to think rather than mash same old 2 buttons.Best of all, It's one of the most immersive games you will ever play."

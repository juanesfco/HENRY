But it seems that Nadeo has forgotten about it's PC players. There isn't basic stuff like control remapping and proper graphics settings. There also aren't customisable skins or dedicated servers. The new art style is cool but after playing a little while I've noticed tracks that are IDENTICAL to previous games.Really disappointing."

Although it was much, much harder than the original game at points, it was very enjoyable and the soundtrack is awesome.It occured to me at the end of the mod that since Aperture Science and Black Mesa were rivals- they were set in the same universe... Mel's gonna meet whatever is left over from Half-Life 2..."

In the age of broken AAA games being released nonstop and $60 indie games with triple A marketing this game is a beacon of hope for games. Stardew Valley is developed by one person and is a polished, working game (can't remember the last time I said that). The art is well done and 60 hours in I've yet to encounter a bug. This game is absolutely worth every cent,"

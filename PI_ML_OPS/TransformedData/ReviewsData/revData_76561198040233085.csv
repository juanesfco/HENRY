I mainly played GT series on PS before pCars. Anyone that says you can't play with M&K or controller is just being an idiot you can play fine with them. Pros:The best racing game I've played in terms of:Graphics,Sound,Tracks.Cons:Lack of cars,AMD runs poorly on Ultra (just turn particles to low, fixed it for my friend at least.)"

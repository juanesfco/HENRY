As a trio of civilians living in shell of a house, you start from scratch and essentially progress through the game by gradually improving your hideout, as you simultaneously stave off disease, depression, looters and hunger.  Balancing all of these competing threats is significantly easier said than done.The game really evokes the grim reality of a modern war, in both its art style and gameplay.  Losing one of your civilians is actually quite emotionally profound; each civilian ha their own backstory and specific skill, but also hopes and dreams, as well as interesting quirk (e.g. smokes, or enjoys reading).  Keeping them alive is tough, but in my first playthrough it was not disease or depression that killed my poor family, but blundering into armed thugs and being shot for their troubles.  As inglorious and abrupt as these ends were, it didn't break the immersion whatsoever; people die in stupid ways in war.  What's more, the civilian deaths deeply affect your fellow characters, severely depressing them.  Let this go unattended for too long, and they may commit suicide.  Brutal.As wonderfully depressing and harsh as this game is (and long; a dev. commentary stated that the war could progress for as long as mere weeks to months!), I did feel that the weapon, and shooting, mechanics could be explained a little better.  I don't really know when the best situations are to use firearms, how to acquire all the necessary parts or even how to use them.  BUT, this is a minor complaint, and reflective of the fact i chose to ignore firearms completely in favour of scavenging as much as I could peacefully, then getting the hell outa there.All in all, a really emotionally profound game thats incredibly depressing, and tough to play for extended periods of time.  I highly recommend it!!"

While it is similar to Skyrim in some aspects, a lot of the mechanics have changed, graphical styles are different, and there are many features in place to optimise the game for MMO gameplay.Warning: this game is highly addictive. If you start playing for a bit, don't be surprised if all of a sudden 2 hours have passed."

However, the game is growing rapidy, and after playing it for a little while, you might grow to like it.If you enjoy TF2, CS:GO, or other Source based games, you are probably going to like this game. Basically, you work together in a team of up to 5 players to either plant a bomb and escape, all the while fighting zombies (Bomb Escape), or hold out for as many waves as possible (Survival).Give it a try, it's free and not a massive download."

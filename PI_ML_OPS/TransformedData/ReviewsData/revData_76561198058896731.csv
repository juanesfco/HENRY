,Posted May 6.,,374320,No ratings yet,True,spectacular game! but the down fall of the game is the new health systom where when you die your health is at the minimum not like DARK SOULS I and II where each time you die you loose little by little and then you use a humanity to regain it all back. but in this it has a default health set for when you go undead. another downfall is the servers are still ♥♥♥♥ and makes it hard to summon players. but over all the game is amazing to play!!

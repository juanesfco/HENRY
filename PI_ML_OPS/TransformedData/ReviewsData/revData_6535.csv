This game's limitations are endless. 100% garunteed you won't find a more exciting, fun and adictive zombie survival in early access. From playing it quite a bit, looking back on it, I would happily play $100 for this game. I've spent a lot of time on Dayz, and plan to play a lot more from the looks of things. Watch out for stairs, they're deadly."

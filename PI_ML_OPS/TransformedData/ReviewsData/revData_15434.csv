The world of stillwater is so much fun to explore, and there are even some activities that didn't make it in to Saints Row the Third and Saints Row 4. Play this."

The only problem is that the ending is anticlimatic to say the least. Buy it, sale or not, and be ready to murder many robots."

I would say that it's a bad game, mostly because it's trying to be a horror game and it isn't, it's extremely overpriced, the graphics range from okay to eye-bleedingly bad, has way too many bugs and the story is extremely hard to follow. BUT. Even though it really doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, I'd hate to say it, but the co-op is sort of fun. I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome. So... I give this game a recommendation."

There was something new that was introduced in the batman series was the Multiplayer mode. It was nerve-wrecking to play it and it gave a lot of competitive teamwork. It was a legible attachment to the game, and looking forward to keep playing this. This of course has it's downfalls and the biggest downfall was the suit. I mean would that be a bit heavy for someone who needs to be lightning fast? Look at the logic!. Whatever I say about this game, this game may not be as it should be, but overall it is entertaining and fun with full of possiblities. I would recommend this game for any Batman loving gamer out there!"

Although it gets boring... I've had my experiences with this game, but it gets old and stale. I had that feeling that it will eventually get old. Old or not, this is TF2, and we shall commend it's most outstanding  success in the Steam society!"

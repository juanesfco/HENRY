For something that started as a mod forHalf-Life 2 this game is pretty amazing!There is so many gamemodes out there that I don't think ANYONE has played them all once!You will need the content from CS:S to run many gamemodes (Models/Maps)Gamemodes I would recommend:TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town)GMod Tower (You need to dwnload content from workshop)/ Murder Stalker    (These two are about the same. 1 person killer except in stalker he is invis & everyone has weaps)Role PlayingZombie SurvivalAND MANY MOREGarry's Mod is literaly 500 games in 1You can join a constant killing eachother serverYou can Role PlayYou can spawn WatermelonsI 100% Reccomend this game & it is DEFINETALY worth the $10 (Or wait till it goes on Special)

,"Posted May 31, 2014.",,209080,2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful,False,"Guns of Icarus Online is a First Person Western Shooter that is horrible in every way possible. This game is obviously a failure of a Call of Duty clone. The level up system seems to use unrealistic millitary ranks. I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥ is a 'Powder Monkey?' You also lack the ability to prestige making replayability nil. The weapons.... Oh dear. You don't even get to hold the guns. They are mounted onto your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle and the aiming is horrible. Most guns don't even have ♥♥♥♥ing iron sights. And here it comes.... the worst part... the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle. You heard me, sniper rifle. There is only one of those in the game and the idiots that made the game called it the 'Mercury Field Gun' thinking it sounds cool or some ♥♥♥♥. Well it doesn't you filthy hipsters, just admit its mean't to be called the L96A1 Bolt Action Rifle. Oh yeah, I forgot. ITS NOT EVEN BOLT ACTION AND IT ONLY HAS 2 BULLETS. YOU ALSO LACK THE ABILITY TO DO 360 NO SCOPES. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DEVS LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN ACTUAL GAME!!!Overall I give Guns of 'I-♥♥♥♥ed-your-mother-hard-last-night-carus' a 420/69 - IGN."

,"Posted May 6, 2015.",,269250,No ratings yet,True,My Impressions after playing for 1 Hour so far:+ Great Artwork+ Story is really well told and will keep you engaged+ Great Soundtrack= Music sometimes loops weirdly (Halfway through a song and will loop back to beginning don't know if its a bug or just me)- A few minor typos in the story- Quite a few CG's are just left Black- As far as Im concerned there are no choicesThis game is certainly worth buying for the story and art but just a reminder that this is episode 1 in a series. If there are going to be more episodes of this game it is reccommended that you only buy this on sale.

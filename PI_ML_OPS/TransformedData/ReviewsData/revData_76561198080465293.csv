,"Posted January 1, 2014.",,730,No ratings yet,True,"the only reason this game doesn't have a higher metascore is because it was reviewed when it was first released. in 'flashback' articles you'll see prevoulsy scorning critics giving it 10s because it's improved so much. maps have been added, crates like TF2, weapon skins, so many community contributions, map tweaks, gameplay upgrades, new game mode, the list continues. this game needs more players, all noobs welcome, the community can teach you the tools of the trade even if uyou're hopeless. :D have fun on CSGO, deffinitely worth anyones time (in my case, 400 hours of time (right now anyway))"

The game play mechanics run smooth and clean and have a crisp feel. To all you hardcore Source and 1.6 fans i recommend that you try it out but don't be surprised that you are suddenly terrible since this is not on the new half life engine... Overall this game is a fun, smooth game you can play competitively or casually.Rating:8.5/10"

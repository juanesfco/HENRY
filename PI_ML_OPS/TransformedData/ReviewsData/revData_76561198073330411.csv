1 person found this review funny,"Posted December 22, 2015.",,200510,No ratings yet,True,I think this game is amazing but there are alot of issues that i have which alot of others also have aswell that you will hit an enemy and the shot apparently misses like i can understand a zero damage shot from defence but otherwise it's a good game which is improved upon with the xcom enemy within dlci would recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based stratergy
,"Posted October 30, 2015.",,9450,No ratings yet,True,in my opinion the game is good but ever since i updated to windows ten my game has started to crash at the end of battles and doesn't save so i am winning battles but not getting anything for it becuase windows ten could you see if you could optimize the game more for windows ten or contact mircosoft to better optimize there systems

Not only does it get a 10/10 from me, it also makes me shed tears at every little surprise it springs up. GG Walking Dead, you're the first game to make me cry."

I really wish it was more then 2 hours worth of interesting stuff but oh well, it was alright but the only thing I would have to complain about besides the shortness of it is the cost of it, for 2 hours worth of gameplay I think at least it could be $5."

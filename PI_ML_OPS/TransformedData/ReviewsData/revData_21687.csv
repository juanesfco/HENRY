I saw other reviews and they said this had a 'Story', I'm not sure about that but notice I've only played one minute on this game.... Because that's how long it bloody took to finish it...

Then load. Then B to C. This sounds monotone to you but if you play with friends it's going to be the best. Left 4 Dead 2 brings you a 4 player co-op, Zombie killing game. If you ever get bored with the game well, Their are mods on the workshop. This game does have a bit of story to it, The Crew start off at a hospital(No Mercy) and must GET DA THE CHOPPAH, HEIRGH. Well. It picks up from there and goes into the second campaign, One of my favourites was... Well I forgot, I just know it had a choppah and The Second Crew was there.Heh. 9/10 for me <3 Only didn't get a Ten because of the Point A to point B thingRemember Kids: GET DA CHOPPAH, HEIRGH"

Although, You will need to buy Counter Strike: Source to have all of these games graphics. If you are patient enough you can wait for the Garry's Mod, Counter Strike: Source steam sale.This game is awesome, I have spent a tonne of time playing this game"

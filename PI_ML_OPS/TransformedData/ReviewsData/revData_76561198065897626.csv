,"Posted April 18, 2015.",,214420,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,"Now this is a good game, nice graphics, decent maps but to be honest it gets annoying when snipers insta-kill you from across the map, and then when you find a game without any snipers it just gets boring after a while. Yes i know i only have 1.8 hours in total and yes i am still a rookie but it just gets old, the matchs go for a while and after a few minutes it just gets boring. There isn't a lot of maps either so you will end up playing the same map over and over again. Also there are not HEAPS of tank parts so you don't get heaps of variety, sure there are quite a few but not heaps. Also when you first start out you'll end up with some lame tank which will easily get destroyed. After a match you get points, with these points you buy diffrent tank parts, but after a match you don't get many points, and, like i said it gets boring after a while.Any way like i said im still a rookie to and this is just my personal opinion, but the game is free so you can give it a shot and who knows, maybe you might like it."

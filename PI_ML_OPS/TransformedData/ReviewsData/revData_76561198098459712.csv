Even if the choices don't have as strong an effect as they do in other Telltale Games, the story and the character really put you in Westeros. My only issue would be graphics but it really doesn't matter. This is a Game of Thrones fan must-have."

With the musical accompaniment, the atmosphere of every scene was almost perfectly toned. This is a beautiful story. I won't be forgetting it any time soon."

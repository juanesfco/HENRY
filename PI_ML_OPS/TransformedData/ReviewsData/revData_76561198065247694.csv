,Posted February 24.,,433340,No ratings yet,True,"Even though it seems the game is basic for now, I cannot wait for more and more to be updated, Highly reccomended if you want a first person tycoon where you collect ♥♥♥♥, and not just any ♥♥♥♥. Pros:-Amazingly beautiful visuals-Slimes are the best!-Many upgrades to keep the fun going!Cons:-The game doesnt have many developers, so it will take time to update the game, unfortunatly-Tarr are everywhere, no matter what-Its hard to get going, because some players will give up!Even with the pro's and cons, I still HIGHLY reccomend this game!"

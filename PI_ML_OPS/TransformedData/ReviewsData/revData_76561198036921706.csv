,"Posted December 26, 2014.",,242860,No ratings yet,True,This game is great. It's a ww1 fps that uses trench warfare which is very different than the standard military fps.Overall the game is very addicting and very fun. It would be amazing if they added a higher player count for awesome epic battles.i would also recommend Ro2: Heroes of Stalingrad the game is also very similar to Verdun

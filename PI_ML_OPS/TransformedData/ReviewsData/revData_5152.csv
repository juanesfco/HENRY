Number 1. The server crashing has been fixed and yet the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviewers still leave their negative reviews up.Number 2.You need a good computer to run Hitman, i feel that is something people dont get so they just leave negative reviews. and finally number 3. how impatient do you have to be to release a negative review for a game just because its being releases overtime. the gameplay is great. its more open than Hitman Blood Money. the best hitman so far."

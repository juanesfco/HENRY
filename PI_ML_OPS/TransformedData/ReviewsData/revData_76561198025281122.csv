(prediction is a bit odd, pushing enemies away might make you miss a subsequent short range attack)alt-tabbing out of the game switches sound to some ambient sound rather than going silentall UI elements and in-world details and turn mode overlays, including battle borders have a lot of neat animations going onlots of lore to unlock and readin-world designs includes painted imagery of electronic components and PCB without making it garish like games from the 90shas a newgame+ mode that can be repeated many times without resetting your character stats. all battles are scaled appropriately"

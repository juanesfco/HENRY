I had less lag from an emulator, and emulators are usually known for having lag. Don't recommend this until they patch this out, this is ridiculous."

It is a lot scarier, and a lot harder than the previous game, and has a much more stable system to keep you on edge. Definitely pick this up, especially if you're a big fan of the first game."

The game is also addictive to an unhealthy level, with the 2.2 hours I currently have on factorio being from the first launch. :/"

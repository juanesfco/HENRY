If you like musicy things, and colours, and annoying platformers, this is for you! I started playing this and the music was really cool, so I wanted to hear more, and I continued. And failed. A lot. Then I quit. "

If you dont want to build random stuff, you could play Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Prop Hunt,  or watch youtube in a cinema server, or play sledbuild,  or............................ *never ends*"

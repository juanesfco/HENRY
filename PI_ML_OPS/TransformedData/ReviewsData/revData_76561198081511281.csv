You can do tonnes of stuff like lick people, headbut people, be a giraffe and play Flappy Goat!(Flappy goat seems alot harder then the real flappy bird) You can unlock new goats like the jetpack goat, blue streak goat and many more! You can also download goats and maps from the steam workshop. Have you ever dreamt that you are a goat and you wanna trash a city? Well Dream no more! (Wow dreaming no more sounds a bit sad...) You can actually be a goat and trash the place!"

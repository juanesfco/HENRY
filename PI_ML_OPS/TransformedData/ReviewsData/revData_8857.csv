I would've prefered it if you had a mode where you actually have targets that arent a part of the story, and you get money for it and stuff (i know contracts mode has stuff like that but a constant internet connection is required) The AI are kinda stupid too... And when someone finds a body, there could be 100 people there and the AI targets.... YOU! .... just in a crowd staring at a crime scene as people do... and the Cop targets some random aged guy in a suit!! i mean... COME ON!!!"

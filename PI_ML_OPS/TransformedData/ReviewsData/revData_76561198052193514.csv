It's emotive, tough and makes you feel desperate to retrieve and steal items your people need to get through. I cannot recommend it enough. If you're looking for something that challenges you emotionally and strategically this is the game for you."

Then for some reason I just stopped playing.Last night was my first play through since then and I was absolutely amazed by how things changed.I LOVE the inventory system, it's so simplistic and a lot easier to manageAnd the building system is another feature that has taken the simplistic road making it a lot less of a headache and a lot easier to build quickly under pressure of other players in the area.Also the maps a beautiful, filled with colour and sound, the only thing is (maybe it was just the server I was on) I struggled to find any deer or boars (but that's not a fault of the game and was just possibly the server I was on)I would definately re-recommend this to previous Rust enthusiasts, I'm glad after months of debating whether to get back into it or not that I did. So much work has been done (as opposed to other early access games I've been playing) and you can tell developers are moulding this into a top contender of the mulitplayer survival genre"

Worth buying but kinda wished we had more the 2 lives and a server to play with more then 2 players+ but overall its a cool game that sometimes(All the time) makes to wet your pants if not a mini heart attack.

,"Posted November 21, 2014.","Last edited December 5, 2015.",232750,No ratings yet,True,Its a good game! But wished there was more stuff which we could do. After beating the game you can't do anything which is quite a bummer since the game would be an amazing place to explore. But overall its a good game.

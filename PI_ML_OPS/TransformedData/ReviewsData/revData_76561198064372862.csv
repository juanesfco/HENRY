New to the Warhammer Universe but from what ive played so far; Graphics are awesome, easy learning curve to the strategy aspects, cool executions and nullifies the repetitive feel of normal chess, turning it into something i'll continue to play for many hours to come. You sorta have to play for ages to level up your stuff but its worth it. Overall very fun game, and authentic to the 40k universe9/10"

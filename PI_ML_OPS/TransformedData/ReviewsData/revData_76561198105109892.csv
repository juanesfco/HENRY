,"Posted September 4, 2015.",,301520,No ratings yet,True,this game is amazing it is so much fun know that u can get items faster. but the only problem i have with this game is that when your in a battle adn your game freezes and no ones moving to only thing u can do is exit out of the game but then when you go back into the a multiplayer game it says you have to wait 2 minutes when it wasnt your fault the internet crashed and veryone throse so know you are waisting your day trying to get into a server. but ather then that problem the game is super amazing. with all the cool robots people make the community is great. what i dont get is that you have to be 13 to play the game when you cant swear so the game has miner issues other than that the game is great.i would rate this game 6/10 jsut becuase of all the problems with the servers and the age. i know iam being harsh on a game that is early access but still hopefully they fix dat problem.

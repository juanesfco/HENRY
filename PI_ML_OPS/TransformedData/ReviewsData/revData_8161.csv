The easter eggs like the borealis one are amazing. The plot twists aren't expected unlike most games where you know what will happen next. I'm a huge fan of greek mythology so when I found the oracle turret, my mind was blown! Cave Johnson was definetly a great character to introduce and to help us find out more about Aperture. THE ENDING, I absolutely loved the ending!!"

This was done in close to 40 hours.At first I was a bit sceptical about this game, but I decided to buy it anyway ($1.50 on sale) and I was very amazed at the amount of detail there is through collectable items, talismans and bending. The graphics are alright, the story doesn't make a lot of sense inside the LoK universe, but the bending is absolutely amazing! Overall I give this game a 9/10."

Definitely one of the best soundtracks ever too, it has so many songs all for a low price, unlike other games that have very few songs and cost heaps, I'm very glad to see that it's in the Steam Music player now."

Terraria is very simular to Minecraft...its a 2D game not 3D...Zombies come out at night...simular thing occurs in Minecraft and so on. In Terraria, if u get the special requirements sometimes, you can face off against a boss of some kind....Hint here: The hardest Boss in the game is The Wall Of Flesh which is only found by dropping a Voodoo doll into the lava down in Hell...I Wish you good luck and I hope you can make a better house then me!"

I think the people who own CoD should just get rid of it and play this instead. Csgo is one of the only games i know that has recoil and spray patterns. Its very beginner friendly because people have to play deathmatch or casual first. But what if there was unranked competitive? Wouldnt that change the game so noobs can easily learn to play competitive instead of casual.

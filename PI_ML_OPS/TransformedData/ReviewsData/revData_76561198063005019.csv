Variety weapons warframes and abillities or known as mods. Mod your weapons with upgrades and make your warframe stronger. Conclave (pvp match) is very fun to test your frames abillity against other players warframes. Choose your fight style: Go rush in as melee and hack every enemy up or try to be sneaky and take them from behind. Different types of missions such as Rescue Sabotage and Survival. Overall amazing game and one of my favourite F2P's.

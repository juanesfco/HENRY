However don't expect many similarities with the previous installments, as they are few and far between."

At first glance, mini-metro seems extremely simple and relatively easy, however dig a little deeper and this game will bend you over the proverbial table. The minimalist design is refreshing and suits the game perfectly. I thoroughly recommend this game."

From the completely unique story, and masterpiece of a soundtrack, Toby Fox has created a game that should be experienced by everyone. The narrative of Undertale provides a level of emotion unrivalled by any game of the current generation, as well as light-hearted humour that never seems out of place. STAY DETERMINED!"

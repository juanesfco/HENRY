Grind against your buddys to get the best gear!Also if you get bored on your class you can choose another class or all of them and still keep your old class. theres all different type of skills like (Disciples of War: Archer, Gladiator, Lancer, Marauder, Puglist,) (disciples of Magic: Arcanist, Conjurer, Thaumaturage) (Disciples of Hand: Alchemist, Armorer, Blacksmith, Carpenter, culinarian, Goldsmith, Leather worker, Weaver,(Disciples Of Land: Fisherman, Botanist, Miner.

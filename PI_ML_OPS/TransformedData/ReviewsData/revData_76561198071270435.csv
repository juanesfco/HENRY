The physics, driving and explosions have improved a lot from Just Cause 2 and the graphics overall are so realistic. I really liked the setting of the game, its very exotic and colourful! The wingsuit in this game is the best wingsuit I've seen in any game and is so awesome to use. I would definetly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of explosive fun."

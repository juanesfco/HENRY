Hunt, fish, scavenge, build. The gameplay is fairly balanced, and the menu is easily used. It plays akin to Minecraft with the same blocky style, yet more animated and with a much smaller world, and death is redily available, just ask a zombles. And its free and receives fairly regular updates? Hell yes this game is amazing. 9.5/10 Rubber chickens, only missing 0.5 due to the fact that the editor is mystifying."

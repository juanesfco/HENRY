Star Conflict is a space shooter, filled with action packed games with simple yet challenging objectives. Star Conflict will alsways keep you entertained and engaged. Star Conflict offers different types of combat space ships, from Long Range Frigates to Recon Interceptors for the close up type. Tired of fighting players in PvP? Star  Conflict offers PvE, where a squad of 4 people are pitted against bots while they complete objectives.Smooth, clean, and engaging.Star Conflict has something for everyone to enjoy."

There is no clear upperhand with any weapon, as each weapon is balanced perfectly. The classes all have balanced strong and weak points.This game is definatly worth your money."

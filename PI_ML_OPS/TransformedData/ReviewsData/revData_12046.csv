Well i guess this earned a review thenThis game is great for going on a binge or just when you have 5 minutes to kill. It is a nice arcadey experience and the randomly generated galaxy with random scenarios make no two playthroughs the same. Each ship requires different strategies adding replay value, if you can actually complete the game and actually beat the flagship which can be a real cun-There is also a great mod to remove the end fight and the rebel pursuit called infinite space so you can just keep on going, exploring and doing ship combat until you die horribly."

,"Posted December 22, 2014.",,234390,No ratings yet,True,Fun game difficulty is hard and weapons only spawn on a specific level so if you dont scour the entire level then you are going to be running and using weapons inneficiently this is a amazing roguelike game if you want a challenge play it. you will die and die and die and die *you've been warned*

Extinction is lots of fun and I definetly recommend it. The Multiplayer is fun and so is the character customization. At first it performed badly but thanks to the nvidea control panel everything was under control and it still runs smoothly. If you want story, fun and action, get this game. Can't wait for Call of Duty: Ghosts 2. (As the ending of the Campaign clearly suggests it.)"

However, this game will keep you hooked for many hours. It's quite challenging, but don't let dying over and over throw you off. This game is quite rougelike, with the randomly generated floors. The powerups vary from a laser that replaces your main projectile, your own tears, to using your own urine as a weapon (which is one of the worst items in the game). The game is great, but if you aren't sure about the game being on Flash, maybe you should wait for the remake. This game is one of the best games i've played in years, and at $5 it's an absolute bargain."

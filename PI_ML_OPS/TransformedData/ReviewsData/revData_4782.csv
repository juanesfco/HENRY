The combat is interesting and challenging, characters are memorable and complex, and with enough in the game to make you want to replay the whole thing. This is no doubt my favourite game of 2014.The game constantly throws moral choices which effect the gameplay pretty significantly, and with death very real within the combat system it always keeps you attached to your party members. Although the story is very unique and might not be for everyone, it's deep and full of backstory if you enjoy discovering things on your second or even third playthrough.I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys turn-based strategies or difficult games."

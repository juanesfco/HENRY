You can make rockets with pretty much millions of combinations. Unleash your creativity! And just let them all out. Go to other planets and explore them! Or... For an alternative way of 'fun' you could.... SMASH your rockets to pieces and pieces!! Make a rocket with crazy combinations and try to get to the Moon. Is the rocket too heavy? No problemo! Just add extra thrusters and BOOM!! To the Outer space you'll go. In this game... You're the engineer...10/10"

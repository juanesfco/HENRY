Super hexagon is probably the most difficult and challenging fast paced game you will ever play. Good if you play a lot of FPS games, really helps."

,"Posted September 14, 2014.",,205930,No ratings yet,True,Hitman: Sniper Challenge is a branch off of the main game Hitman: Absolution. It offers a unique mission in which you test your skills as a silent assassin. Though small it can consume as much game time as the real game. Great for playing with friends.

,"Posted April 18, 2014.",,570,No ratings yet,True,"Dota 2 is a finesse based strategy. Cooperating with bots, players or just yourself tackle across a battle ridden plain to wreak havoc upon enemy lines. Focus you gameplay style however you want in a diverse fighting system and enjoy decent length games of traditional overhead MMO style combat fun."
,"Posted April 18, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"For a tear-off mod, Gmod is very good. Most games of this style have died in a month but Gmod has gone on strong for many  years now. Not a high recomendation but the various styles of gameplay within the game can cover a grand amount of time."

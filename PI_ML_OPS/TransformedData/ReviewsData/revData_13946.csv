I enjoy the movement feature as it does not have the same amount of jump boost as Advanced Warfare and it makes players move around the map alot more. For Zombies the original Shadows of Evil map is ok although i mostly enjoy the simpler maps such as the giant where you can just turn on the power and pack a punch etc. Overall the game runs well for me and i would recomend buying."

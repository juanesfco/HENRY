While the graphics aren't the most current or 'next-gen', they do convey the action on the screen in an easily understandable manner."
,"Posted August 27, 2012.",,50300,No ratings yet,True,"Yet another favourite title, Spec Ops: The Line is pretty much the video game equivalent of Apocalypse Now with the same sort of descent into madness which the player character, Captain Martin Walker, and his two squadmates are subject to. It sucks you into thinking it's another generic shooter but it is in fact, a complete deconstruction of the otherwise stagnant genre as it is today. Well worth taking a look at, at least."

Definitely a game that anyone who intends to go into politics or foreign relations should play."

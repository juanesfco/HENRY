,"Posted December 23, 2015.",,224540,No ratings yet,True,This game is alot like Minecraft and TF2 and it is much funner with the new DLC (Hurt + Heal Pack). So i Recommend it to every one who plays Minecraft or TF2 it's a really fun game with different game modes. But it's such a shame that it costs money to buy the game D:. But it is still fun. :D -Hope every one likes this game ~keyman015

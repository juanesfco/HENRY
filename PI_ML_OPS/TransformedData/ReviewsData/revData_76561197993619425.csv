Could you do us the honor of delivering one ?"

Although the mechanics at the moment feel very cluncky , the games overall feel makes up for what it currently lacks and im sure will be rectied in the future.I would recommend buying this game after a few updates, but if your like me and received it for free over the weekend, its a fun addition to any steam users libary."

The Slimes always say Hey!. Especially when I'm chopping the trees, to build houses containing NPC needs.They like to sell me stuff, and use my Gold, But it's ok, I get so much loot, I cant even hold. Most of my worlds are small, and the pre-hardmode bosses are dead, but no tears have been shed, because after the Wall Of Flesh, I'll be dead, dead, dead, dead. You see the game only gets harder, More enemies, more bosses. You will die, and cry, but then find wings & fly. This game is like this rap, it's bad & it's good. But unless you explore, you'll be stuck farming wood..."

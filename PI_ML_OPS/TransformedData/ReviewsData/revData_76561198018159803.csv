There's a reason it's got the biggest population on steam. F2P and not P2W.Like a cross between hitting the level cap in WOW in 30 minutes and playing chess in real-time using 10 out over 100 difference pieces.
,"Posted September 14, 2015.",,113020,No ratings yet,True,Great game I keep coming back to. Worth it just for the old-time piano heist music and french accents. Low graphics workload and minimal need for mouse-clicks means I can play on the laptop near my wife without annoying her. ONLY downside is low/no multiplayer populations when I feel like playing.

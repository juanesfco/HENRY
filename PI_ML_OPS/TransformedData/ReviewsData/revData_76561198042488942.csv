,"Posted April 27, 2014.","Last edited April 27, 2014.",221640,No ratings yet,True,"This game will make you hate hexagons (and anything to do with lines).Straight off, this game is HARD. You will probably rage a fair bit, but that just somehow motivates you to go on further. You are a triangle that has to dodge six sides of incoming lines using the left and right arrow keys or A and D. You will hear the 'Game Over' voice alot, but just completing a level makes you feel so good. The music is very good, as expected in this genre. I would personally rate this 10/10 because I enjoy playing 'rage-games', and this is a great one at that."

There are so many things done right in this, truely a spectacular racing game. EA shut down the store, which is such a shame because that Jansen hovered at 88 mph. Multiplayer is stil great fun, although not too many people play it anymore so it's best to get a bunch of friends and have a good time. A great classic, a great buy. If you enjoy racing games and for some odd reason never played this, I would definitely recommend it."

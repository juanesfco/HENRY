I hope the ratings don't go down to negative. Cause' the game has enough problems as it is."

Still a decent game though. Just buy the game and DLCs during a sale to actually play the game without spending a lot of money.*EDITSince Update 100 came out and microtransactions were removed, the game is now going back to its roots. Overkill listened to the community and that the next generation of safes will be completely free, except for the old gen. You'll still need to use a drill to open them. The revamped skill trees introduced by Update 100 have changed the way you play the game, in my experience at least. Some skills were nerfed (Inspire) others were buffed (Sentry Guns) and some were merged with other skills. In a way, this new system allows more roleplay and tactics during heists. Oh, and the update made Akimbos and the Saw to be usable by default which should have been in the game from the start. Anyway, Overkill also announced that they now own all the rights to the Payday franchise. Which means that they'll support the game throughout this year to the end of 2017. I don't know what'll happen to the game at this point. Overkill gained most of their fans back and they support them in return. So I guess that the game will survive after all."

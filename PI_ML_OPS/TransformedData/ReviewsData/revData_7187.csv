They basically toook the concept of evolve but did it MUCH better. The only problem i have with it is that it takes forever to get a game, because it only searches for a couple of seconds and if it doesnt find a game it says no matches found and you have to click search again which can get REALLY annoying. If they fixed the searching i would say it is one of my favourite games but i just get bored of waiting to find a game, and its not like you can go watch youtube or anything cause you have to click search every 5 seconds."

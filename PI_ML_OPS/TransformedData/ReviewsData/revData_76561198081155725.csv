Infact, the gameplay really reminds me of Journey (which is another game I love heaps).So as soon as Frima Studios announced that the game was released on Steam I knew I would be buying it straight away. But, I saw that steam recommend that you play this game with a controller...unfortunately, I don't own one. Eventually, I brought the game and decided to try playing the game using the keyboard. At first it can be quite difficult to but I say within 30-45 mins you'll get the hang of it and will be fine with it. I have been playing as a single player which is still fine and great but I do recommend playing this game with a friend, buddy, pal etc. You'll have tons of fun as there seems to be alot of levels."

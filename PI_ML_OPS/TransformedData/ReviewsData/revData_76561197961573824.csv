Everything is fluid and simple.The combat is less 'rewarding', the early weapons suck even more than in Dead Island and progression is a bit slow. You're punished via Stamina much more heavily.There's a better leveling system (think Oblivion) you gain XP is different categories as you just run around and kill things (agility/combat/survival), the skill trees have depth.The performance is ok. It gets really bad outdoors (40~) and even those on high end SLI 980GTX's are reporting the same frame rates. Needs some patches for performance, but I haven't noticed any in-game bugs so far.Co-Op actually works. I dropped-in games fine, and people dropped-in mine. Night time allows for PVP (someone can attack you as hunter), but you can turn off this mode if you get annoyed. Online can be set to private, friends, public or off.I haven't played enough to give this a score."

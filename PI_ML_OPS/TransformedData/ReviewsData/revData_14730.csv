I have had 15 dollars of fun in my 1.3 hours of playtime, What can that say for the future? A lot! So just give it a go, and yeah I know there are a few bugs but hey its a new game, and it can only get better, so get behind the developers and boost them so they can make this game the best survival game out there!"

Otherwise this game is fantastic, if all these bugs were fixed and the game be left as it is in all other aspects, I would literally, like ♥♥♥♥ in my pants, but for now, that aint happening, Developers, Why u do dis ;-;"

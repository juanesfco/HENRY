In many people's opinion it was better than GTA IV. Although it wasn't perfect, the sheer size of San Andreas was something that could not be denied. It had country sides and even the city of Los Santos. This was R* (Rockstar's) best game until GTA V. Even thought GTA: SA is old I still enjoy playing it and it's still  great game. The story is great and the open-world is fun too. I highly recommend it.(it's better than minecraft)"

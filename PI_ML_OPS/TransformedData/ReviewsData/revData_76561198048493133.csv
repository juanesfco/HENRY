In FTL you are put in charge of a spaceship sent on a mission to warn the Federation of the oncoming Rebel assualt. Travel from beacon to beacon, blasting your way through enemy ships, exploring mysterious planets and browsing the catalog and your nearest space store, all from the comfort of your own chair! FTL will have you coriographing epic battles, calling the shots on important events while all jamming ot to a funky set of beats. Now quickly, power up your faster than light drive and let's go kick us some alien/robot/rebel butt!"

The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn't dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints. Instead when you talk to people you are shown still images that tell a short tale. From what I can tell the story is 'You're part of a race called Blue-Skins, who did some bad ♥♥♥♥ and are hated. You are approached by Anubis/The Jackal who is supposed to be god, he asks your help to fight an evil called Judgement, the Jackal makes sure you do this by giving you a disease that will kill you unless you help him seek out and destroy Judgement!'Tl:dr You're a smurf who needs to help a dog god kill a big black thing, also you've got cancer.The game itself has a lot of big pro's and con's that will likely affect your decision on buying itPro-Amazing art style-Amazing music-Difficult gameplay-NG+-No dialogue-Pretty cheap price when on sale-A few difficult achievments to work towards-Makes you want more high quality gamesCon -No Dialogue-Sometimes unfair and a bit frustrating-Only one story or way to play the story-Pretty short game-Makes you want more high quality games-Capped at 30 fpsSo I put some stuff in both Pro and Con, I doubt I have to explain why but I will just in case.Stuff like no dialogue are both good and bad, depends on the point of view.Anyway my final review of this is  8/10 Gameplay  6/10 story 3/10 replayability  7/10 Overall  Like Dark souls and Zelda violently ♥♥♥♥ing behind a bar "

Fun for a bit but not $20 fun, $5 fun is a more fair price. SUPERHOT IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS! "

To me this seems like a big step in the right direction and I am happy to reinstall the game and play more if it helps Overkill return to their former glory."

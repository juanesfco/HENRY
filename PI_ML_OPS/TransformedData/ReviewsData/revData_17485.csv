Funny characters, if a little cheesy, and a brilliant collection of humour. However, I found the options to do things different ways a bit of a waste of collecting items, and found that some items remained in the inventory when they had no further use. But, can't complain, I got 13 hours out of it! For the price I paid, that's a bargain.4/5"

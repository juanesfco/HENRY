With Afterbirth coming out in October, Isaac is going to get even better.Also Bouncy Blood Urine Lazers will be great42/10"

,Posted September 17.,,452650,No ratings yet,False,"I received this from winning a raffle with free entry, and it still wasn't worth it.Incredibly lazy worldbuilding, models and AI, Sounds are on the edge of pointless, even on high-end PC's there are generally issues and crashes which make it unplayable, whilst also having quite long load times for such a simple and barely function game. Firing a weapon is near impossible, as it requires you to only be able to use the crosshair, aiming down sights shows you the incredibly generic weapon models, and blocks your view near completely. The enemies can't kill you, and even if they could, you'd be dead instantly, as their AI is incredibly limited to waiting until you get near enough and then proceding to push through the walls to kill you. If the Dev even cared anymore, he could at least attempt to patch this game, but that in itself would be ~such~ a task.TL:DR- The Dev needs to get his ♥♥♥♥ together if he wants people to play and buy this game."

I was a late adopter but really did love this game. Crimefest ruined it, don't need ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t microtransactions.This is just a money grab and writing this review to make sure Overkill knows this ♥♥♥♥ is not on."

Easy to pick up and play, the game is simple enough but is pretty addicting. Only annoyance is sometimes clicking out the window but it pauses automatically when you do. Others say it seems more like a mobile game, but the fast paced nature of the game lends it self more to the mouse where it makes it easier not to screw up"

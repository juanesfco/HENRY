It's great, has tons of content, and the only thing i really think it lacks right now is 'classes', like what terraria has. Sure, it may not of been updated for a while. But nightlies are kind of like updates, so there's honestly no reason to hate this. Starbound has a few things it could improve on, like monster generation and terrain generation, but other than that it's near perfect. I'd rate starbound 8.5/10"

But i thought to myself 'One day i'm going to get good at this.'30ish hours in, with 48 hours of research and homework on how to be good, and i still sucked.Horrible game, russians everywhere, don't bother."

It's your typical first person swordfighting game, but it has a massive, MASSIVE learning curve.I'd never recommend this game until it becomes an actual fighting game instead of a blocking simulation."

,"Posted November 29, 2014.",,265930,No ratings yet,True,not so sure on this game. yes i enjoyed playing it but in my mind glithes are only funny if they are out of place whereas this markets itself as being full of bugs so you go in expecting to find them. if you havent played it then i would recomend picking this up while its on sale

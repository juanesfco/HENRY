,"Posted January 12, 2014.",,204450,No ratings yet,True,"this game has a great bases for more content, though i think it is a bit short, though that definately does not mean i didnt enjoy it, it's gameplay, while sometimes showing minor bugs, is overall good, it is fluid and all the guns feel great. the revolvers feel like the best guns in the game, but that is because i only use revolvers. but in any case this is a game that while not being a huge game, it is definately worth its price, and if a havent convinced you with this review then at the very least consider it when  it goes on sale."

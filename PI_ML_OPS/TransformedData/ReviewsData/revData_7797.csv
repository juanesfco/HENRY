Lowest graphics and it's laggy. I did manage to play for 20 minutes but after a while I realised I wasn't having fun.I know everyone wanted planets, but it's too much for the current engine."

My rig is middle-high of the range and could run on lowest graphics fine, but I don't want to run on lowest settings, and this is the first game I've had to do that for. Half the experience is the graphics. Feels clunky and a little unbalanced for beginners - I was constantly being killed by dinos and slowly learning that water, forest and beach has unsafe creatures. I'm sure it will get better, but does not yet get my vote."

,"Posted December 30, 2015.",,252870,No ratings yet,True,Cant even complete a mission because an AI or Player ship is always there to stop me from getting back to the mission carrier. 8/10 Very nice concept and the ship battles are intense

,"Posted December 30, 2015.",,242760,No ratings yet,True,Great survival game about trying to survive from cannibals and mutants after crashing on a mysterious Island. After a while though the game does get a bit boring for me after finding everything but the updates always make me wanna play this one
,"Posted December 30, 2015.",,383120,No ratings yet,True,"Awsome concept and space survival. In my opinion the game is a little complex but it does have brilliant features like Open world planetary exploration, Flying from one planet to another without a loading screen popping up and many other unique features"

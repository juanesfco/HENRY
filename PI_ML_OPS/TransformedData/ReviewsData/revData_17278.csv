The best passport and documentation simulator I have ever played.I highly recommend Papers, Please to anyone, no matter what specific genre of games you are into.Nice try Jorji, MR_PERSISTENT.Glory To Arstotzka."

It is a very good visual learning tool for this, however it is definitely not for everyone. DO NOT purchase this if think you will learn Korean or become fluent by playing. It is just one the many tools that you should be using to learn the language. If you are a visual learner, than Influent will help with your vocabularly, but remember, this is only one of the many compnents of learning a language. Make sure you are purchasing this for the right reason or you will be disappointed."

It has a great art style and is very easy to pick up and play, as you will learn as you go. Its that easy, and makes it that much more fun"

,"Posted July 8, 2014.",,209160,No ratings yet,False,"This game is already in the bad books for gamers this year on console, and the pc version in no way any better. In fact, this game on pc is one of the worst games I've played. Unless you have a high powered gaming pc to use, you'll experience terrible framerate on most maps and badly loaded textures. The DLC started of alright, but has steadly gotten worse and more boring with each release. This is definatly a downgrade from previous call of dutys like black ops 2 and mw2. Not really worth buying."

Allowing you to do as you please, Garrys Mod allows for the most random singleplayer and multiplayer fun! Whether it be riding dinosaurs to exploding a nuke to crash your game, Gmod has it all."

,Posted May 27.,,255710,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,This is the best city building game i have ever played. It does everything that simcity 2013 failed to do and more. It has good graphics. Amazing simulation. Suprisingly realistic water. And where do i start with the mods? THERE IS A MOD FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! And they are easy to install using the steam workshop. (If only minecraft mods were this simple.The only annoying thing is it doens't have natural disasters. (However there is a Tsunami mod).10/10 for everything.

I loved playing as engineer but I also like other classes as well!ProsFREE!  Lots of Game Modes! Lots of Classes! Helpful Turtorials! Single player and Multiplayer! Lots of Different Types of Weapons! Lots of Maps!Cons To do well you need to buy a few weapons! Can be boring if playing without a friend! is vilont and bloody (Is a Pro if you like that kind of struff)! If you want good weapons without paying it can require a lot of hours!

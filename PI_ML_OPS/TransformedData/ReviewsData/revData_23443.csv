Well, the player interaction can get a bit messy, when the occasional asshat makes you eat bleach, but when you're saved by zombies by a stranger or given some food it's all worth it."

Nice steampunk art-style, enjoyable gameplay. One bad thing is that all the servers are american/europian etc, so us Oceanic players get pretty bad ping.Nevertheless, an awesome game."

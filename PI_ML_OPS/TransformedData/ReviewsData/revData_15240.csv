,Posted May 5.,,32430,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,"The concept is cool but the execution is sub-par. It is very linear which is not nessesarily a bad thing depending on your preferences.The biggest problem I had with this game is that the menus are completely broken. There is text missing, especially in the menu that lists the combos, to such a degree as to make it impossible to use. Opening the game options locks the game up. The frame rate drops dramatically in some areas and the keyboard/mouse controls are awful. In short it is a bad port."

( my time played is more like 30+ hours). this games is ok and is worth buying especially if you can get it even cheaper on a sale but understand that after a few hours all up, what was at first amusing chat just becomes purely annoying repedative (they repeat lines) banter (that you cant skip).There are free, equally good / better poker games online. google 'free online poker' and click with your eyes closed and you'll find one, alot of which you will also be able to play vs friends or random people, which this game CANNOT do.www.yazino.com (one i've used, can vs ppl / friends, it has a credit limit but u can sign up fake accounts for more {if your decent you shouldn't run out of credits])https://zynga.com/games/zynga-poker  (on mobile devices or facebook, havent used, just checked)http://www.replaypoker.com/  ( i haven't used, just checked site )."

(although some tables wont seem great at first they grow on you the more you master them and the free trial really doesnt do them justice)i recommend the 'Marvel Pinball Original Pack'.p.s. tables are usually at around 50% off during seasonal sales

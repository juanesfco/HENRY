,"Posted February 15, 2011.",,8190,No ratings yet,True,"Really, really awesome game. It is actually just one massive huge level with no loading-zones at all. Massive legendary fun driving around this place, it's like a not-♥♥♥♥ version of GTA (and seeing how everyone loved GTA... imagine how cool this game is!)."

If you do not play this game, you are denying yourself one of gaming's true treasures, and you can't come to my birthday party."

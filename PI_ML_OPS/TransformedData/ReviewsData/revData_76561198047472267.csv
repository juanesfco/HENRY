The physics in the game are so realistic, I've been waiting for a racing game to produce that forever! Not to mention the graphic detail they put into the destruction of the cars! Overall this game is a 10/10 in my books. The future looks extremely promising and i'm sure the game will only get better!! Short Form - Well worth the money, you will not be disappointed."

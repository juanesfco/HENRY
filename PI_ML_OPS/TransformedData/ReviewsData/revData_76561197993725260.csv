,"Posted January 2, 2014.",,203160,No ratings yet,True,"Really enjoyed it - good reboot of the series with a nice mix of combat and leaping.  Moderately competent AI, great setting, and a fair plot (if a little predicatable) rounds this out for a solid recommendation.  Single player campaign weighs in at ~20hrs."

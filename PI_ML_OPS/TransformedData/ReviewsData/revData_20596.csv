,"Posted December 13, 2013.",,224260,No ratings yet,True,"are you searching for some realistic zombie game? well this game is a great choice for you.each weapon has their own mag, like 9mm, why? it's too hard for you to fit the right mag because in other FPS game you could just pick up ammo stash or other weapon? WELCOME TO REALITY MAN!!and once you get bite, no hope bro, you. ARE. INFECTED. Sloowly so you can give your best for your mates before you becoming one of themat first we only got a BARE HANDS, so we need to find weapons quickly before the zombie comes, wether it's range or melee, so realisticteamwork absolutely NEED in this game. Go solo, and you are dead."

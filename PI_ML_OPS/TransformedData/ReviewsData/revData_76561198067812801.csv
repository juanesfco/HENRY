Has a fair unit diversity. GREAT controls an OK thou buggy modding community and I mean going against 10 people with the ability to blow up whole solar systems is just fun. On the other side the game has optimization issues sometimes destroying a planet leaves the units that ware on it witch is terrible for performance.But when it comes down to it your going to enjoy the game either way(specially if you have a good computer)EDIT:(A mod has been released witch doubles the amount of units)

I strongly believe that it will be more entertaining and a better use of your time and money."

I got it early when it was $12 and it wouldnt run on my old af pc. So I got a new one and tried it out. Terraria in space boi. I somehow got anyother copy of the game for free. idgaf what other people say but If I were you I would wait for a sale before buying dis game. Just sayin! If you really want what this game says it gives, Starbound is a better option. But if you really want it wait for a sale. A summer sale. This summer sales its on 3.74 maybe you can buy it. I don't know. Or  If you really dont want to spend money on it come to me. I have a copy I would trade with you. 5/10 Would wander aimlessly again"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The game is a combination between csgo (tactical and game mode), dota 2 ( abilities ), TF2 ( class or maybe call Operator). But the problem is the loading system is too long, a lot of glitches. And the funny thing is why all the operators can't jump ?"

I like the double barrel shotgun, that is my personal weapon. One terrible thing is there is no control option to change button to play it easy, i played the free version on my old computer."

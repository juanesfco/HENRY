The game as a great story from start to finish, filled with mystry and some crazy characters and documentation if not all, to immerse the player in the experience of visiting Mount Massive Asylum. The fund experience of Mount Massive Asylum has left some impressive spooks and scares on me, and the characters are not to be taken lightly. Mount Massive Asylum and Outlast itself has proven itself to be capable in narratating the context of the scene and story of the game and illustrates the significance of  a great story through immersion from the characters and environment."

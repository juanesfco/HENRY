Make the game longer, and make sure there is a way to win by actaully remembering which one is good; not by complete random guesses. My advice, look at what you are trying to make, and put yourself in the eyes on the user. Hope that helps you out on your next game."

I enjoy this game because it never is the same. the oppenents are different, the skills needed in fighting them maybe a noob or to a pro. a real challenge thats still fun, yet get you to work with different moves. Wonderful. 9.5/10 "

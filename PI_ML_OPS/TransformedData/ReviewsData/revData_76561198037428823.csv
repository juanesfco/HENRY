,"Posted June 19, 2015.",,237990,No ratings yet,True,Wow. This game had me on the edge. Tears and mead powered me through this. Absolutely stunning. I haven't cried this much since episode 6 of S3 of Vikings. The combat had me a bit overwhelmed so I put it on easy and that let me nejoy the game to the fullest. Simply incredible. Sk√•l.

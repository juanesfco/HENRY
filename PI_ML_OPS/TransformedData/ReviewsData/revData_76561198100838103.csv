It really is a fun MMO, love the classes in this game and the general idea of Eidolons. Isn't overly as difficult as other MMOs I've played, but it still is pretty fun, especially the higher level you are. If you're looking for a more simple yet fun MMO with action, I suggest you play Aura Kingdom. :DAdd me if you want, on Hydra server and IGN is Varshmat. c:"

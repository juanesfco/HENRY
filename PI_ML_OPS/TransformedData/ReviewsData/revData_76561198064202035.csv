,"Posted November 6, 2014.",,219150,No ratings yet,True,A bloody good time. this games is both one of the most violent and most fun games i have played and left me wondering when I started to enjoy being an such evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. the one hit one kill machnic makes an interesting change to the uual health system but it is still fun if you enjoy a challange. the gameplay is almost that of a puzzle games as you plan out your way through areas. one of the most digustingly fun experiences one can have with a video game. 7/10
,"Posted November 6, 2014.","Last edited November 6, 2014.",207170,No ratings yet,True,"One of my all time favorites, great game full of challenging puzzles and thrilling fights aswell as a twist I never completely saw comming.  It has a suprisingly fun combat system that keeps the games combat interesting but can get slightly boring after a while and a deeper story on the character you are playing would be nice. 8/10"

,"Posted January 11, 2014.",Last edited January 2.,730,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,Game Content : 7/10The Game Is fun no problem running the game able to play with my friend and it is the best FPS game Valve ever make. Downside : Due to the recent update the update of the rank system have directly destroy the community. They in order to manage the rank they derank most of the player by matchmaking them with lower rank people and making the higher skill group player trouble ( Hard to Carry ) If they reupdate :  if they resume the rank system and add more rank to manage equally well that will then be a perfect 10/10 content/overall

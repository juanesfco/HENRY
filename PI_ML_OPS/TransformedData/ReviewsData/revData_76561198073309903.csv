,"Posted October 7, 2015.",,351710,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 is a great game all together, with the same game breaking experience as the whole series on ps vita and PS3, filled with kawaii anime waifu's, awesome gameplay, 4th wall breaking, video game references and more! So if you're into anime, video games, JRPG'S, and are looking for the perfect waifu ;) (for all you who haven't played it yet, you'll get that reference later) then this game is perfect for you, just make sure before you buy it you check the specs and make sure your not attached to your social life. Good luck have fun :3"

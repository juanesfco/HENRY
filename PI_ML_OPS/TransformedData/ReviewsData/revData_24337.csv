Although this game isn't historically accurate, this game has great variety in it's gameplay and always puts up a worthy challenge every game you play without getting repetative. Whenever I play this game, I cherish the fact that the most peaceful person in the modern world advicates his philosophy of peace and love by dropping nukes onto his enemies.My verdict? Get this game! Although the large price sum, it's a well-worth game!"

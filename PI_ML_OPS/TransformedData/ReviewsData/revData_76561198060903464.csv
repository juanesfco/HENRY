,Posted April 18.,,242760,No ratings yet,True,This game looks pretty and runs well. I would HIGHLEY reccomend this game it is updated often and with every update brings lots of content. The building is good for early access and for a small team is amazing. The multiplayer is good and runs fine as long as the host has a good internet/computer.Buy it.

Graphically impressive. Great soundtrack.+ Incredibly unforgiving game mechanics.Cons:- Incredibly unforgiving game mechanics.- Some elements of the gameplay can be somewhat grindy.- Has crashed a couple of times. (Vista)My general rating: 7.5/10"
,"Posted February 14, 2015.",,25990,10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"An old-school hybrid mix of RTS games like Warcraft and Warlords Battlecry, Sim games like Theme Park/Hospital and a touch of RPG/Strategy mechanics.Pros:+ Still fairly unique mechanics for the RTS genre.+ Some levels are insanely hard.Cons:- Doesn't seem to run very well in Windows 8.- Has randomly crashed a few times in Vista.- Some levels are insanely hard and somewhat luck based.

,Posted June 25.,,335670,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"An Earthbound-inspired JRPG with a unique (for the genre) storyline, characters and setting. Story is something like Hokuto No Ken (Fist of the North Star) combined with Children of Men.Pros:+ Compelling storyline and characters.+ 30+ characters to customise your gang with.+ Somewhat unique JRPG in terms of odd mechanics. (permadeath, game ending cliffs, storyline decisions with consequences)+ A brutal, dark and depressing storyline.Cons:- Some of the odd gameplay mechanics can be a bit rough at times.- Goes pretty deep into dark themes and feels.My general rating: 9.5/10"
,"Posted January 1, 2014.","Last edited February 6, 2014.",630,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Really good squad-based, co-op, F2P, top-down view shooter.Pros:+ It's free!+ Interesting objective-based missions.+ A potentially large variety of team/equipment setups.+ Challenging higher difficulty settings and game mechanics.+ Generally fast-paced.Cons:- Currently only one official campaign with no sign of any further official campaigns or missions in development.- Most of the official campaign missions are reliant on keeping the techie marine alive. (can be a pro in terms of raising difficulty)- Certain weapons/items range anywhere from completely mediocre to completely useless. (this can also be a pro in terms of raising difficulty)- Can't (read: shouldn't) really play it single player.- Online player activity is generally pretty quiet these days.- Levelling/Promotion system feels slightly gimmicky and grindy to me.My general rating: 8/10"
,Posted June 25.,,379310,No ratings yet,True,"A sequel/epilogue to Lisa The Painful which is more of the same JRPG style. Generally a darker and less comedic story compared to The Painful.Pros:+ Compelling storyline, settings and characters.+ Great soundtrack.+ No random encounters. (with the possible exception of one semi-random encounter)Cons:- Limited gameplay in terms of characters and game mechanics compared to it's prequel.- In combination with the aforementioned limited gameplay, the combat strategy can be of a somewhat linear trial and error style.- Like it's prequel, gets into some pretty dark themes and feels.My general rating: 8/10 (Story: 10/10 / Gameplay: 6/10)"

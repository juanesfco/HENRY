,"Posted January 18, 2015.",,65980,0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,now that i have completed a full game i feel as if i can write a fair review. civilization beyond earth whilst having amazing graphics and relatively smooth gameplay still falls short of reaching civ5's standard. there is no where near as much content and the ai doesnt run as well. a couple of touch ups and a bit of hard work and this game could become a good game. nothing like civ 5. but still worth having in you library. 7/10

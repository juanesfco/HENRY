The game was so bad I quitted, and didnt even toutch it for a few months, waited for it to be fixed, and now it is.I played the game again and now I do feel like completing the story, and stuff.After the fix I think the game jumped from a 6/10 to a 8/10I now recomend this game and am deep sorry if you also pre-orded it, hope this helps"

I also recommend you buying the second game! Telling another tale which is even better in my opinion!Buy this game, its worth every penny."

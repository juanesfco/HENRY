The lag was terrible, shots wouldn't hit anything and the rocket launcher was insanely overpowered. Yet, despite all this I had the most fun I'd had in a game for ages.In the subsequent beta tests the lag became far less noticable and in the prerelease version it was down to no more than internet speed. One should approach this game as something akin to Planetside 2; but as one constant battlefield, with no commander and the ability to spawn a Hercules Jet whenever you want. This game is the embodiment of chaos, and I loved every second of it."

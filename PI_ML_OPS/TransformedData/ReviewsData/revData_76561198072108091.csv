,"Posted December 7, 2012.",,71340,No ratings yet,True,"This is the best Sonic game I've ever played. A bit hard to play with keyboard, especially when you're boosting and drifting at the same time. Problem can be easily fixed by using a wired Xbox 360 controller. The game may be a bit short, but it's worth replaying. Try completing everything! There's a few flaws that may cause rage quits, but overall it's pretty good. This is a PC-port of the Xbox 360 version. If you ever find a really cheap price for it, grab your chance and buy it."

This game pretty much puts everything you want to try into one. May if be making a giant ♥♥♥ catapult or a flying car. This is where you try it."

There is also plenty of mods on this game that you could try out, giving you more zombies to go agaisnt and more difficulty options. I may only have 92hrs but this game is bloody great.. Watch out zambies, here i come :P"

Already got me kinda hooked other then the only way to customize your character is to buy coins with money :/ Other then that, good weapons only take 1 or 2 battles to be able to build. So go on, build some stupid weapon that will have the other guy rolling his eyes at you when you kill him."

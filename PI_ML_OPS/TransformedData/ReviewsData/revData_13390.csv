TONNES of stuff to do and a good singleplayer as well as multiplayer experiences. I found myself 24 houring this game, never really is 'nothing else' to do. Big promising updates for the game, not very often though from what I remember.I have no major negatives of this game that I can pick out, only that there is alot of items and I find myself on the wiki a bit.8/10 still play."

Minecraft Style I guess...'However, after playing it for almost 2 hours, I've realised that this game...Is nothing like Minecraft in terms on gaming content/adventure.If you've ever wished to get DayZ and want to get a first-hand experience of it, this game will be a great start!I do recommend that you guys play with a friend, and not Single Player (Just yet...)My feeling about this game is that it will become a game that requires intense TeamWork, Co-ordination and communication (Recommend: Use Voice Chat in Steam for the meantime).So for those who feel this game isn't worth playing because it looks boring, please think twice...I would have regretted my choice if I didn't choose to play this game for a while."

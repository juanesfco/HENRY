I don't bother playing another minute, if you want to play this (which I did) you will (when playing on servers) be constantly kicked for 'Suspected Cheating.' when you don't even have a single line of code for a hack! And from what I hear it is highly pay 2 win, but don't trust me saying it's pay 2 win because I aint playing another single millisecond of this piece of junk."

This game deserves to be removed from gaming forever. The storyline is downright terrible and can cause you to go slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The voice acting is terrible, animations are glitched beyond imagination and there are so many other things that are bad about this excuse of a game. Overall It's just a terrible game that should be WGOTC - Worst Game Of The Century. FINAL VERDICT:0/10 DISGRACE (This is why there is a 0 in rating. To rate games like this which are terrible)"

,"Posted April 9, 2014.",,550,No ratings yet,True,"I describe this game as awesome, best FPS next to TitanFall and CoD, very team based, has a ranged variety of weapons, and the greasest enemy ever; The Tank. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a thousand. I recommend this game to people who like Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive."

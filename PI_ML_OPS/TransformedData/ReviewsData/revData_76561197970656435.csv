,"Posted May 1, 2015.",,320300,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,This game is awsome iv played over 5 houres already and i only have one problem. Im finding that you need to grind to get any  where i would like a mode where  can do everything without needing to unlock becuase the main reason i moved to this game from the older game is the car restoration.

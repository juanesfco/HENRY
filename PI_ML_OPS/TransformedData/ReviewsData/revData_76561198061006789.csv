Its a balanced and competitive game that will doesn't take much of your time....unless of course you continue playing for years and years (like I have been) and see how much time you've spent on it!

Sure there are some minor issues in gameplay but the soundtrack, voice acting and character arcs are the most powerful aspects of this game . It reaffirms my preference for video games over TV/cinema as a story telling media . So if you do play video games, I think you should at least try the first episode! 10/10. PS - don't binge play all the episodes, give your poor self a break. You'll thank me for it."

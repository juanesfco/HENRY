And that's suprising compared to some other games that have been released this month *Cough Cough* Black Ops 3.Although, there were a few problems.For one, whenever I go near the river at Sanctuary, my frames drop and it's a bit annoying.Also, sometimes when I launch my game, the graphics screw up and it annoys the S*** out of me.But in all, this game is beautiful and the story is great.I give it a 8.5/10"

,"Posted June 7, 2014.",,221640,No ratings yet,True,"Love this game, although it makes me wonder if anyones actually ever finished it. Would recommend this game. Kinda reminds me of flappy bird, as I am constantly trying to beat my past personal best. Good game to play without internet connection as there are few updates. Would definitely recommend this game."

Reasons are, i died around 15 times in 10 minutes. the camera is F+++++ stupid. cant see this big fella at the beginning who is casing you, because your egos head, body or what so ever is in the way, i always try to sneak, but he has ♥♥♥♥ing eagles eyes.... it should be a little bit easier right at the beginning!....controls are pretty bad too.played a lot of horror games, but this one leaves me icecold...no recommend!"

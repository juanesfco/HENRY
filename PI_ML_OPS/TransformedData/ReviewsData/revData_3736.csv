,"Posted January 19, 2015.",,33930,No ratings yet,True,Me and friend lined a helicopter up with a roof of a silo. We both took deep breathes as i stepped back getting ready to leep from the roof to the door of the heli. I take one step I here the gravel crunch under my characters boot time slowed down it felt as if I was in the game . Time then starts to speed back up I pushed my speed to its limit stepping of the building i leep towards the heli i prepare to climb abord ..... I land on the side of the heli still running and some how run up the side over the top and down the other side to fall to my death . super realistic  10/10

,"Posted March 23, 2014.",,271290,No ratings yet,True,The game is awesome.. It is Free to Play but it is not Pay to Win.. You required a good skills in the game to win... It is fast pace which is nice.. Would recommend it to my friends and family. The only downsize of the game is that you need to spend real money to customize the look of ur mech other than that it is not bad..

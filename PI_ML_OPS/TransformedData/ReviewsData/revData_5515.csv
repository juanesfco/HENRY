When you first start a game you choose your character. You only start of with a Ex-Milltary soldire and a Hunter. 2 CLASSES! when you start. The Game Looks Pathetic and it runs really bad only if you have a really bad PC). Combat is Sluggish when attacking zombies.Their is a leveling up System Thats Ok But not the best Compare to GTAV Or Battlefeild's Leveling up System. Loot is SO easy to find which is Ok. I wished the develpers(Sorry if i spelled that incorect) Made more maps and upgraded the graphics a little more. I think Infestaion is a RipOff of DayZMy Final Score 2/10

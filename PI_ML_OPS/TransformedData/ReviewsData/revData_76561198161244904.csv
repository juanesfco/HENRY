,"Posted May 29, 2015.",,214420,No ratings yet,True,it keeps crashing. i dont know why but it does so i cant recommend this game but for the time i did get to play ( Couple of minutes like 10-20 minutes) i cant dislike it so im not sure. so i will just recommend it.
,"Posted April 18, 2015.","Last edited June 22, 2015.",359800,No ratings yet,True,Ok so this is really good. I have been playing this for a while and it is like free less content version of Gran Turismo. Really fun. Controlls are a bit wierd but you can manually change them yourself. other then that it has good potential.LIKE!
,"Posted April 1, 2015.",,346900,No ratings yet,True,Its ok i guess. it could just go on a website or something. but i like the fact it is on steam. Also i dont know why i cant get lemons anymore. they stop produceing!Sounds wierd but its true.Overall good game.

,"Posted November 13, 2014.",,440,No ratings yet,True,BEST GAME EVER!If you like childish but still adult to basically any aged games and you like 'SHOOTING' people...then this game is for you.
,"Posted November 13, 2014.",,262410,No ratings yet,True,This game is kinda pointless. its still fun to see whats inside guns. And this is kind of educational.I pretty much recommend this if you want to learn what makes guns work!

Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY

But seriously this game is extremely interesting with loads of different content every day and endless fun. I have really had some amazing times with friends on this game on Dark RP and Sandbox because of people that put effort in making servers and addons.-Confuzzled

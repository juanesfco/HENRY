,"Posted December 25, 2015.",,327860,No ratings yet,True,from 1.5 hours of playing the game i think i can somewhat get an idea of how awesome this game wil be.initially it is very annoying to start (like any adventure/survival game) but you get used to it soon enough. the visuals are lacking but the gameplay makes you forget about graphics completely. overall: it's a great game to play and i really can't wait to see how far it comes. i really do reccomend this.

Think about what you'd get if you crossed playing Diablo like dungeon crawling, with first person shooter, Warcraft 3 style graphics and procedurally generated maps: THAT'S ZIGGURAT!A must have for any gamer in my opinion, it's great casual fun.  Or you could take it seriously and try to beat the ziggurat!A great game, that is also available for Linux!"

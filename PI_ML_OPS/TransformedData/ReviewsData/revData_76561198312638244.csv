,Posted July 8.,,362890,No ratings yet,True,this game is a perfect remake of the original half life. personally one of the best remakes i have played in a long time. there are a few changes in the remake but for the most part its almost the same as the original half life.the game still needs Xen to be completed but all the other chapters are ready for you to play and enjoy. i say buy this game if you loved the original half life. but avoid it if you can t wait for xen to be completed.

,Posted July 25.,,252490,0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Rust (Legacy) would have to my favorite survival game by far. New rust would be in my top 5 but if you played legacy it doesnt even come close to being as good. Rust is a great game i would highly recommend anyone to get it soak up lots of hours make friends and have a great time.

,"Posted July 25, 2015.",,314660,No ratings yet,True,So ive only play like an hour but still i can tell that it will be a very good remake and i usally dont like remakes but if you really liked the 1st game or even the second i would recommend this game. Bought back some great childhood memorys back when i 1st play the 1st one on ps1.

,"Posted June 14, 2014.",,201810,No ratings yet,True,"Wolfenstein: The New Order is a surprise on every level. I obtained the game through perhaps unethical means to try it because why not, after a decent first mission i was intrigued but where the game truely got me was when i put my controller down in title sequence. Every cut scene is filled with more cinematic flare than most movies these days and the gameplay complies thematically, it's such an effective combination i purchased the game legally after but a few missions. This game is really fun to play but so are alot of games, what sets Wolfenstein: The New Order apart is that its story doesn't interupt the fun, but instead adds a great deal to it. Do buy this game."

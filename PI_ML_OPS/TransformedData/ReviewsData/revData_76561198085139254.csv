I have a high-end PC and ♥♥♥♥ trying to get this to launch half the time. Takes anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes to even launch, and when it does be lucky it doesn't crash on start."

,Posted August 20.,,201810,1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful,False,Very surprised by the positive response to this game. Heavy stuttering despite the absolutely horrible graphics. Textures are bland and of low quality.Sound design is nothing special.Gunplay is also bland and unsatisfying. The guns feel like they have no weight to them.

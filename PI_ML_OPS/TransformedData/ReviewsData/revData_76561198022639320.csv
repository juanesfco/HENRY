,"Posted December 20, 2015.",,296970,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,A lighthearted rogue-lite turn based tactic game. It's very good at what it does and with a simple yet deep rock paper scissors combat. It has excellent replayability thanks to the different approaches and play styles you can try. I'd recommend it to anyone into strategy games.

Once you get in the game you will play for hours at a time without realizing then boom, there goes your day. I recommend getting it with both the expansion pack because they fix a lot of the problems in the game while adding a lot of content."

,"Posted June 30, 2014.",,225080,No ratings yet,True,"An interesting game. No UI, not a single word in English, super simple controls, and yet, it tells a really good story about the struggle of 2 brothers (lel) in a fantasy world. I strongly recommend this game for anyone looking for a game with a emmersive story with some puzzle platforming. 10/10."
,"Posted June 27, 2014.",,241600,No ratings yet,True,"Fun challenging rogue-lite which had me going 'one more try' for hours. Controls are tight, as long as you are using a joystick, game is fair and the bosses are tough. There is a lot of variety in game play with different classes and stats. Recommended."

Responsive controls and satisfying combat make this a fantistic indie game that everyone should give a go...just make sure you use a controller. 9/10."
,"Posted August 17, 2012.","Last edited December 13, 2015.",440,No ratings yet,True,"A classic PC First Person Shooter with a very strong user base, and is legendary on steam, and for good reason. It's chaotic, funny and addictive, with great class balance and fun modes galore. Still the best FPS I have ever played, if not one of the best games ever. 10/10."

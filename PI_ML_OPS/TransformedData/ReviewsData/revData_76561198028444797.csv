Arena Wars 2 fits nicely into this category. Fast paced RTS that puts you straight into the action, no mineral collecting to slow the game down. It really is a joy to play a game that hasn't been done what can seem like hundreds of times. "

At least when that happens, when your own robots yell at you cause they are being beaten up by the enemy, you understand that this is not the normal kind of strategy game you are playing. Graphics, humor, AI and simply fun is perfectly combined in this awesome game. That was nearly 20 years ago..."

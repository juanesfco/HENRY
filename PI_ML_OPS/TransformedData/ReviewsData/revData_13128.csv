Many things come into play like recoil or accuracy when moving. Would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. If you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. The competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. Without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns!10/10

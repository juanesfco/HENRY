Thanks."

Also, the lettering/font/type takes a few seconds too many to decipher at first. That's neat & quirky, but it gives me a microscopic headache every time I try to read characters' speech bubbles.'Still a freaking-damn great game for its price. Buy this for your friend."

Dude, wt♥♥♥♥. (If the handling is too much to work on dear 2xFine, please extend that time limit. QnQ )Despite the way the framerate my computer can produce for this game and the delayed command input making me cry metal f*cking tears of blood, I would reccomend this game because-- 'woo! celebration of ROCK! clever lines! open world exploration! pretty neat funny shnit!' 'But the limiting driving handling made me want to smash my keyboard, pull out every keycap, and then smash them for not helping me when really it's just how well my proccessor & graphics can handle everything this game's trying to run. After trying the game with a ontroller, it was much more fun, but ♥♥♥♥..... I hate having to drivein the game.It's much more interesting to run around the open world than freaking driving in it-- only because driving will give me cancer."
,Posted June 6.,,346110,0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,I get a staggering 4-10fps in view of a large base or a large dino crowd. 15-20fps away from crowded environments isn't That much better. v.vI am not yet ready to continue enjoying the ARK.

I've played through only the first two areas as'f this writing (A and a part of B), and I'm getting the feeling from the computer terminals that from all the kinds of endings the game's leading me to expect, I won't be surprised over it. Everything is pretty and pretty not-within-cheapo-game-budget. Definitely get it when it's on sale."

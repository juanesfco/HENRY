And hes right, Whers the trickshoters and noscopers. Incredibly dissapointing. If your looking for a game where you can yell at kids 'you ♥♥♥♥ed their mum so hard they ♥♥♥,' This is not the right choice."

Bethesda games cease to amaze its fan with products that continue to please them for many years. Skyrim, unlike any other RPG's dedicate themselves into the finest detail from the gameplay to graphics to the point of perfection. 0/10 You can't modify the sky in skyrim"

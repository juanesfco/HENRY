This game is filled with fantasy which makes it fun the trading system is amazing, and sometimes hostiles can be a bit too tough to kill. I would give this game a 8/10 it could be fustrating sometimes but the key thing i like about this game is the idea and the amazing fantasy world the game makers put in for us to enjoy. I recently bought this game and so far I am loving it, even how much I die or loose thousands of souls this game will always be in my top ten favorites!"

This game now has a 25,000% increase in players. Fun and unique, although it takes a bit of time to find the monster; when engaging in combat it is surely worth the length of finding the ******"

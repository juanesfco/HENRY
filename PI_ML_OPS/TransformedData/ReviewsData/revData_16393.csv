Having the information about planes and tanks gives u an insight as to how these tanks performed in combat and all the ammunition with it's speeds, explosive filler quantity, armour penetration capability. I've just been diving head first into this game and it has helped me understand what took place during the second world war A LOT more than world of tanks ever did. ♥♥♥♥ I love this game and there are some questionable 'features' but overall this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing10/10"

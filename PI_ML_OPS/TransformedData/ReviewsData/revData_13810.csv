I've played wow, rift, vindictus, conquer (ew), runescape (cmon we all did growing up!) I was a wow player since vanilla, this game is a lot more laid back with it's playerbase on Tonberry JP, the end-game is more actionbased and requires quick reaction times, this makes SoO heroic and Highmaul Mythic look bloody pathetic.If you're looking for a challenging MMO for raiding? This is your game.If you're looking for gorgeous visuals and to just mess around instead of end-game? This is also your game.If you're looking for a final fantasy game? lol this is also your game.If you're looking for PVP? Look up which servers have the most."

If you grew up watching Dragonball/Z/GT, and enjoy fighters/multiplayer, you'll enjoy this game.You get the storyline mode, as well as a mission-type mode (Single player and CO-OP) the PVP is also very fun and competitive. If you loved dragonball for the plot, youll love this. If you loved dragonball for the action, youll love this too.There is one single thing that should be listed though, unless you have good ping to JP from AU, as well as access and knowledge of port forwarding, you will suffer a lot of connection problems. Mine have since been fixed after forwarding ports. There are a few hackers in PVP, which are easily avoided by playing with friends.You will find no better Dragonball Z to GT experience in a game than what you get from this one. It's worth the money, so is the DLC.And the option of being able to switch the audio to Japanese or English makes it that much betterNOTE: Some features are specific to your region's version of the game."

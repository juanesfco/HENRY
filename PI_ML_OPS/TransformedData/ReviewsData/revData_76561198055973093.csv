Combat works very well and surviving in the wild is hard, just as i imagine it would be in real life. Over a few playthroughs i have frozen to death, died of acute bleeding in the lungs, and of a traumatic brain injury. And if a game has realistic ways of dying then you know its a good strategy game."

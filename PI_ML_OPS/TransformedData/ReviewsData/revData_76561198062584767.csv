The game itself is great; just watch out in case Valve tries to implement the idea again.The creator of the game is calling modders some rather nasty words considering his game was built on the concept of free mods.Don't buy this game until the whole paid mods thing blows over. If it doesn't, there isn't much point to buying this game."

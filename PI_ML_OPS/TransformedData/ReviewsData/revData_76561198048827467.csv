I.e.: the environments are well detailed with a limited framework, not minimalistic blocks that many indie devs use to hide their lack of effort."

The port itself is quite good. Not perfect, but it has been perfectly functional for me.Graphics options are limited, though you can uncap the framerate and enable/disable vsync. MSAA at varying levels is your only antialiasing option. The textures are noticably aged, but are fine for a game that's a decade old. Hopefully some mods can provide some higher resolution textures. Sound works fine most of the time, though some audio samples are of varying quality. I think this may have been the original quality though, not an issue with the port.The game performance is good, with stable framerates when running around grabbing stuff. Hitting a big cluster of zombies with a big object may cause a lag spike, however it is very brief. Loading times are monumentally improved compared to the original.The game itself is a joy to play. It is simplistic compared to DR2 and beyond, but I prefer this. No running around for money like a neurotic Hebrew; no overpowered combo weapons from 'Wrestlemania meets backyard warriors;' just you, a mall and a big bunch of zombies in your way with some believable psychopaths for you to overcome. The game is more serious compared to the other games, though it can be goofy if you choose to dress up and use silly items. This humour contrasts nicely against the gravity of the situation, which can make it all the funnier. The other games tried to play the humour straight and it was overbearing."

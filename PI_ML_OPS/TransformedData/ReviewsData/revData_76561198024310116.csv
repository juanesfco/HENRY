Province is being attacked? Defend it! Enemy province is being attacked by your allies? Assist in the seige! You will die and spawn, then die again and spawn again, then die again and spawn again, then die..... That is pretty much the main gameplay of Planetside 2. While there are 6 diverse class options and 3 factions to choose from which are nice, the most fun I had playing this game was reviving fallen allies or repairing vehicles.Thankfully the game is free so you can give it a try if you want. I however, will give this game a no since I cannot find any enjoyment out of it."

It includes creepy environments, paranoia, terrifying enemies and a disturbing story to create an excellent horror game. The game may also cause high levels of stress so I would not recommend playing it for long periods."

,"Posted August 22, 2014.",,200210,No ratings yet,False,"Boring, I used to play this 2 years ago back when wildshadow ( something like that ) owned the game. The game then was not milked and droopy like a 4 year old cow after the farmer's just lost a child, and then Kabam ( tm or some ♥♥♥♥ ) came and ruined everything by bringing in these fancy package deals. 10/10 would not play. My friends would waste money on this basic game."

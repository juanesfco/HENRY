It never gets old. You can do pretty much everything in this game, from killing your fellow terrorists to watching youtube videos on the big screen with friends; to moving ragdolls all over the place to breaking out of prison! There's just so much to choose from! Overall:Pros:Diverse Gameplay, tons of different gamemodes and creative design.Cons: Graphics should get a remake, A lot of maps must be downloaded manually.I think everyone should get this game, it was definitely worth the money!"

The character and weapon choices are fairly low,  although bearing in mind it's still in early access, this game is worth your while. As with all games, because it's free, where can you go wrong? It only takes 15 minutes to download, too.tl;dr: Great game with almost no cons, great to play with a  bunch of friends."

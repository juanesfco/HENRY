,"Posted July 18, 2014.",,301520,No ratings yet,True,"The concept of this game is good, and for the low low price of free its worth looking into. HOWEVER. The repair costs in this game complely ruin any fun you might be having. Playing 10 games and earning 200 credits is no fun. Especialy when the next gun you want costs 4000 credits. Remove the repair system and the game is amazing."

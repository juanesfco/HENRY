Not only that but it's a decent dlc that provides heaps of content for players to enjoy. The story is strong and the ending has a massive twist, but i will let you find out what that is for yourself. The customising your own car/buggy is amazing as it is not just the same old parkour that you have in the original game, it adds the concept of scavaging almsot every car you come by to make sure you just have those extra screws and other items that you might need. All and all really good dlc with plenty of back story and has alot to offer, so far i've added an extra 15-20 hours to my overal dying light playthrough.9/10"

Awesome co-op game to play together with friends, or even on your own. Love the set challenges in each level where you have to collect a certain amount of green gems, golden yarn and complete it in a set time. Story is actually a sad one if you look past all the joking around and stuff ;-; Hatty ;-;"

The game is actually challenging which now days is what games are lacking in. There will be times where you feel like crushing your keyboard/controller but thats all added up to the fun and challenging factor8/10 would recommend to play."

This is truly a well developed game by WRF studios, there are alot of room for improvements considering this only just got released and has alot of pontential. I am looking forward to what the developers have to do to make this game even better! :)"

VERY POORLY CODED GAME. On top of taht EA has'nt even tried to patch these issues."

Right now I regret buying this game. Opinion and review may change in future, when this game is fixed."

Lots of strategies can be used, early rushes or build up economy for a massive late game army. Each civ has different economic and military bonuses as well as a unit unique to each civ which can make certain strategies more advantagous. e.g Mongol gather food from wild animals faster than other civs which makes their economy stronger early game making an feudal rush a good tactic to cripple the opponents economy before they can bring out units to combat yours. Campaign stories are pretty interesting as well although not always historically accurate."

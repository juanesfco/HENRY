A delightful roster of hilarious characters also makes the game even more of a joy to tuck into. Unfortunatly, some of the Awesomenauts are either over or underpowered, but patches are frequent. So unbalanced gameplay occassionaly happens.8/10 - A top laff"

It's a stunning looking game, but anyone keen on platformers can tackle this in about an hour. In spite of how short it is, it's certainly worth playing again. "

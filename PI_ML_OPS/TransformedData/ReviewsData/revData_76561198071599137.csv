,"Posted July 17, 2014.",,304930,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,One of the most fun games I have ever played and even more fun when playing with friends. Unturned is a very fun zombie survival game that is absolutely free to play for everyone and I see a lot of good things to come for the future updates for this game. 10/10 for me.

,"Posted August 3, 2014.",,234670,No ratings yet,True,A fun game if you are a fan of the anime series. There is a lot going on this game and there is so much to do in it such as side events and doing challenging missions to earn more items.10/10 for me but the multiplayer still needs a bit more fixing to do but overall great game.

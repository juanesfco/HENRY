If you have been playing COD/BF/CS:GO forget all your skills as they  DON'T  apply here as your shots are coming from so far away that the enemy is looking like a dot and takes time to range and compensate the distance to take that perfect shot. Most of my time in the game as been with  Ozzy Gaming [ozzygaming.com] which is one of the best RP (Role Play[/i)] servers out there so I speak from a position from RP. The game does need improvement with its large share of  bugs [i.imgur.com] that need to be fixed.In Short ♥♥♥♥ SingleplayerGreat MultiplayerBugs o the bugsGreat servers / communities                                                                                                                                                                                     -Joshieboy

Boy was I wrong The controls in the game were clunky and at time unresponsive. I understand that this game is early in its life but come on not including sound when riding the bike! that is something that should have been added in a beta at least. I didn't play the game enough to get a feel for the store or all the levels but that isn't going to change the review as these can't change the game core physics unless the different bikes change how you ride(only would change it a bit).  If you want to ride a MTB start small this game is doing it no justice go out to your local trail have some fun with some friends no matter your ability there is something for you to do. I may take another look at this game again in the future if they do a physics overhaul but until then im keeping the money that I refunded from this game and spending it hopefully on something better (can't stuff up two times in a row ;)  )   TL;DR : Core of game didn't work as expected, got refund.

It has some modes that cater for everybody with an arcade mode where all aircraft peform like a shuper hornet on steriods all the way to game modes that will have people with fully kitted simulators with all the nobs and do-hickeys. The way to get new aircraft from the little shitboxes you get at the start of the game is to start researching them earning research points from ingame, don't worry your little WWI biplane wont be flying with end WWII jets as the aircraft are split up into sections where you are only fighting planes that you will be able to take down, this system can be wrong at times where you are flying with your starter biplane aginst planes that are at the end of that teir. The downside to this game is that at the start you are flying to the center of the map to take down the ground units during this time i recomend holding your thrust key with some weight and go get somethingk to eat/drink.

The game offers exactly what its intended, a tycoon simulation trading on the seven seas.The love they have put into views is lost with the camera being fixed behind your ship, which is where the game tries to be different. It does not do it justice imo.Overall the game is good, but not worth its current price tag. if you wish to splurg and love tycoon simulations this game will entertain you for maybe a week max, a day if your experienced player."

You will find yourself fastforwarding the years for money, which in turn makes the years go by abit to quickly.Overall this game is a great addition to the simulator genre, and I hope the devs and modders get behind it. With map size and graphics the game offers alot of potential moving into the future."

,"Posted March 18, 2014.",,242920,No ratings yet,True,"Great indie building simulator. At times it can be boring, especially earning some of those achievements forcing you to play in an unproductive manner. But overall the game sucks you in, you can lose hours playing it and yet with one mistake those hours can vanish into a city failing very quickly from the punishing aspect this game offers.If you're a glutton for punishment and addicting strategical building simulations, this game is for you!"

The HUD is also great and really makes the 'pilot' feel while playing. Two thumbs up. :bdCons: Is somehow looking like a pay-to-win since with cash you can literally get what you need in the long run. Unlocking early items and getting the mechs which somehow ruins the fun. But hey, it's F2P who am I to judge? :3"

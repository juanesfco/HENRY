1 person found this review funny,Posted June 22.,,48000,3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"The art is fantastic, the atmosphere is disturbing and the puzzles are, lets say, 'difficultly' easy. I would recomend this game to the people that are looking for something.. different from most other games. The controlls are a bit dodgy but aside from that everything is great.Also phobia warning: DO YOU LOVE SPIDERS? DO YOU HAVE SOME UNCONTROLABLE FETISH OVER THEM? YES? WELL THEN THE FIRST 40 OR SO MINUITES OF THIS GAME ARE FOR YOU! BUT! If you do have arachnaphobia, R.I.P In Peace."

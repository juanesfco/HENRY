Instead, what I got was genuinely good writing, with good visuals, and a great story. As a fan of eSports, it was interesting to get insight into the more human aspects. Let me break it down a bit. The writing. It was really good. Characters were believable and likeable. The dialogue conveyed what was meant to be brought across. The visuals. The game looked nice. I'm somewhat a fan of the style used here, and the backrounds looked great.The story. Without giving away too much, it follows a upstart SC2 player who travels to South Korea in hopes of making it big in the pro-gaming scene. It was really interesting, and I found myself invested in what it told. One complaint though is that it was over a bit fast, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired. However, a sequel is apparently a possibilty, so I hope that is the case.Overall, this is a surprisingly good game, and I definitely recommend it to fans of VN's and really anyone who looks for a good narrative."

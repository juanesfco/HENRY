,"Posted September 3, 2014.",,202200,3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful,False,Dont bother. The game has some form of ridiculous registration system that never explains why it is making you jump through hoops nor explains how to do them. A more complicated process to access a game you have paid for I have never come across.

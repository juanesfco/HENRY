Just try this one, and see what you think of that trash. Also really impressed with the treatment of women in the game. They aren't oversexualized in any way, shape or form, they're just real women, with real flaws, and imperfect bodies.  I would most definitely reccomend this absolute ripper of a game.11/10"

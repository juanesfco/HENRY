Big fan of Racing Games, and loved this one on my old family PC with a CD-ROM (yeah, a CD :O) I wasn't allowed to play my PS1 during school term, so this was one of the only games I played. 90% finished before, this time I want to get 100%. Totally buy it, for classic Ford cars and a great racing game (wait for discount, like I did :) )"

But it is very addicting with voice, music and constant raging of 'So Close, but next time I'll get it' and doing the trial and error. Very good but get this game during sales when cheaper, not $3"

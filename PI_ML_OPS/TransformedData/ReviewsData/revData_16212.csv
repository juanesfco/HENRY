,"Posted October 13, 2014.",,8880,No ratings yet,True,"Freedom Force was my very first game and will always remain my favourite game as well, it has well-crafted gameplay mechanics that an isometric RPG should have and has entertaining voice acting throughout the entire game. This game is worth buying if you enjoy retro superhero games that will make you enticed in the most addictive storyline that will have you hooked for countless hours obsessing over it. This might be nostalgia talking but . . . the game deserves a 10/10 at the very least."

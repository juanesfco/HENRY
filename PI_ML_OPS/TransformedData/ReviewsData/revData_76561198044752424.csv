,"Posted January 11, 2015.",,310370,No ratings yet,False,"This game is trying way too hard to be 'deep'I realise this game is in early access, so I said to myself before playing this that I was going to ignore traditional aspects of a game, such as gameplay and graphics, and focus on the message it was trying to deliver.That message is an unoriginal one, it's one we would have all realised at some point in our lives. The game itself does not even do a good job at conveying the message. It did not make me think about life, or change my ways, nor did I find it in any way 'artsy'.If you want to give it a go, sure. It's a free and very small game, but it's still a waste of memory.This game is free and has 4 minutes of gameplay, yet I'm still disappointed."

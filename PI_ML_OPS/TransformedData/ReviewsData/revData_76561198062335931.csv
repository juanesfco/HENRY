Terraria adds a whole lot of new stuff that minecraft doesn't have. You can get some cool weapons, caves underground change according to what biome you are in and how deep down you are. At the end of each map there is a chest underwater where you can get some cool loot. One of the hardess things i found in this game was the blood moon. Now im going to spoil what it is but if you want to find out, you should buy the game for yourself."

I got it at the start of December and now im already tier 6 and level 33 after just a few hours of game play. You can build what ever come up in to your mind then put it out on the battle field. In battle you get 1 life and thats it, you can't respawn once you die. All you can do is watch and hope your team wins or go back to garage to fix up your ship a bit. The developers are super friendly by giving you codes at special times of the year for you to use in the game and get bouns! I would recommend it to any person as it is a fun, quick game."

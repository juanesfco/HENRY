,"Posted December 19, 2014.",,63380,No ratings yet,False,"This game is disapointing in that, while it promises a authentic ww2 era sniper gameplay, instead what it gives you is a broken mess of a game with broken ai, flawed stealth mechanics and a disapointing story.However the bullet camera is impressive and the graphics look fairly good, however i believe they can not compensate for the underlying flaws this game possesses.Buy sniper elite 3 instead"

,"Posted July 22, 2014.",,304930,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,good game i love but the main problem is that the zombies are so persistan that if you don't have a weapon once your spotted you either have to risk your life and punch them to death or run into the ocean and the crawlers are so damn overpowered they are really fast for only crawling on arms and their hitbox is tiny and they attack crazy fast and are faster than you and the only way to hit them wthout a weapon is to crouch and punch them which most of the time results in your death but once again great game

,"Posted December 5, 2014.",,263500,No ratings yet,True,This game is good i like the fact that it isn't pay to win and you get dragons and weapons that all look cool but one thing i did HATE is after they said it was completely F2P they told me i can unlock everything for $20 which kinda seems like pay to win as obviously some draogns and weapons are gonna be OP and you can get them instantly for only $20 which gives this game a pay to win kinda thing but the game is still REALLY good
,"Posted September 3, 2014.",,211420,No ratings yet,True,I love this game it is awesome but teh fact that you need a microsft live account to save the game is bull and it is saying that teh code has been used for another account that doesn't exist as i am the only one that knows the code and have 1 account

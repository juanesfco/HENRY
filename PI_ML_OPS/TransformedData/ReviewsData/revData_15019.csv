It manages to pack excitment, a spectacular soundtrack and amazing graphics into such a simple idea. It is an amazing game and even though I have only played a small section of it, This game just blew me away. It's quick paced and doesn't slow down, it doesn't drag on. Bam Bam Bam. Ain't no stoping it! The sound is crisp, clear and absolutley beautiful. The artwork is original and not like all those generic titles we all seem to love. 100% reccommened it. If you want to be blown away by all of its amazing 'edges' (pun intended). Don't stop thinking about it, buy it!"

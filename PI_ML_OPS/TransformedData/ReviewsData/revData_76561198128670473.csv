This game really described sometimes how I feel, I have been battling depression for 3 years and I still have it ,but I am winning. I take medication and goto a therapist. Sometimes my horrors have been real, but I got through it and I don't care about the horrors anymore. I would like to thank whoever made this, my mum for supporting me, my dog for company and myself for getting over everything."

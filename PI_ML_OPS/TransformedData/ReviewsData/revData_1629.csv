I've played a grand total of one game, one bloody game that I joined half way through. This game is broken, all those other hours? That's me trying to fix it, every time I open the bloody game after applying a new miracle fix from the internet it clicks up by a minute like some maniacal doomsday clock, every fix I've tried just hasn't worked. I could play this damn game once, only once and now because of the amount of god damn different fixes I've applied it hasn't let me get a refund. Piece of crap, broke as anything and no work done from the devs. DO NOT BUY!"

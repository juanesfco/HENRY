I started the Amane route, but then back tracked and completed Sachi's first. So for one route, you'd be looking around 30 hours play time to complete. This is included experiencing the bad ending... which left me staring at the screen for about 20 minutes before getting a grip.Get it. Save at every single choice. Enjoy the awesomely weird humour that's everywhere in this novel."

I got my first job and smoothly navigated my truck and trailer to the road, with the mindset of an Australian driver, straight into oncoming traffic.10/10 Highly recommended, doubles as dumbass tourist simulator.The realism could be improved, I saw countless flashy cars actually using their indicator. This is obviously unbelievably fake and should leave such types of fantasy with WoW."

Not sure about the rest of the world, but here in Australia, we use air tools for most things, ie; taking off wheel nuts - not wheel bolts. Also, the exhuasts on a car usually come in 3 parts from the cat back, and to replace one bit, you don't have to entirely remove the rest, just saying.Perhaps adding the ability to customize the cars that come in would add something to it. Like fitting a turbo and intercooler setup to a car, etc.I know it's still early stages, but it could be a lot more than what it is."

Basically, I still recommend the hell out of both this games. RS has a few songs that I wish were in the new one, but 2014 is overall a much more polished version of the system, removing the GuitarHero like style of playing. That being you have to play the notes slightly before they say to on screen or you'll miss them, so in that regard you can't play to the timing of the song very well, which is instrumental in a band, pun intended.Not gonna give pros and cons.Buy 2014 if you want to learn easier. Buy this if you want a slightly better choice of songs IMO."

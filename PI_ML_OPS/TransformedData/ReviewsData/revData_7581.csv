I already have made to civs that i have yet to even leave the system. And seriously, The Australian Platypus Empire will be feared by all."

I haven't played Homeworld 2... ever in my life. I would imagine it will take longer as the resources are a bit more balanced so when you auto collect it when you go to the next mission, it actually makes you think what you spend it on instead of like in homeworld 1, in one mission you get 100,000 resource units some time before the great nebula."

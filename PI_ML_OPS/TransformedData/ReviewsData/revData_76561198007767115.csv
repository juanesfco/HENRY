,"Posted December 4, 2014.",,220200,No ratings yet,True,A fantastic game with so much variety and an incredibly active modding community that continue to add insane amounts of content to the vanilla game. It requires a decent amount of practice before you can really enjoy all aspects of the game but every failure was worth those moments of victory.
,"Posted June 23, 2014.",,17390,No ratings yet,True,This game is really fun to play despite it getting on in years. I probably wouldn't pick it up if it was not on sale but having bought the complete pack for $12.74 it was 100% worth it. I feel that it's a real throw back to classic EA titles that really had some plentiful and great content and Spore really has that. The transition from moving my little microscopic creature around eating photosynthetic algae to becoming the dominant space faring race within in the entire galaxy is truely an experience which I have never seen or felt before in a game. The shear amount of customization available in this game is fantastic and is something that I wish was more abundant in more recent games.
,"Posted June 18, 2014.",,206420,No ratings yet,False,"I really want to enjoy this game and I don't mind that it's effectively a dlc for Saints Row 3, but I'm rarely able to get into game let alone play for a couple hours and then any progress I do make goes unsaved. For no apparent reason my game will just close to desktop and this appears to be an issue many other people have had, I've installed no mods and on multiple occasions uninstalled and redownloaded the game. I'm using a fairly high end pc rig so I'm really doubting it's performance issues. For this reason I really can't recommend the game. I hope that this issue is solved because it really is fun to just mess around with all the things in the game :("

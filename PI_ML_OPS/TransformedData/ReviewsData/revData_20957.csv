Yeah it was fun. 10/10 randomness. In one of the DLCs you can unlock a massive ball of yarn to drive down the street and cause mayhem."

There's always that little bit there that you want to strive to do better at."

Such as the easy ability to do competitive match-ups, deathmatch and more. The ability to re-skin guns for money and open up cases with a skin chances of earning money. GLHF"

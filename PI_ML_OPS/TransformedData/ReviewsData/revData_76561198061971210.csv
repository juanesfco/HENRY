It seems that the little features that you notice go a long way. Final review: The game is worth the money, and cannot be compared to game dev tycoon as Mad Games Tycoon is something unique in itself that allows you to branch into many different aspects of the gaming industry. Conclusion - WORTH BUYING"

I would have to say the trading system and the modernizing of the housing has been my most favourite changes of all."

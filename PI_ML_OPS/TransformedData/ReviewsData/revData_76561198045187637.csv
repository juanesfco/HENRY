,"Posted November 17, 2014.",,250900,No ratings yet,True,"based on my first impresions the game is solid but is easyer than the original, synergys are amazing and some of the new items are great. some however are very much so brokenif you where a fan of the first game this is for you, if you never played it I would recomend playing it.if for some reason you disliked the original i would advise against perchasing the game:note that altho i did not encounter any issues there are some floating about"

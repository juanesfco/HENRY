,Posted January 29.,,239820,No ratings yet,True,"Beautiful - 8/10 Me.Ok, really now. This game is AWESOME!! I love it, I played it for a while now, and I gotta say... It was REALLY fun.Pros:- You can name your games whatever you want.- It's REALLY satisfying to get 9's and 10's- You can make your own engines- There is a lot of game combinations- It's awesome to see all the consoles being released- I love the easter eggs- It's really awesome to hire new people and see their stats ( 100, 800)- It's nice to have millions... Feels good :3Cons:- It's SUPER anoying when you try to make a new RPG right after the last game. IRL people would actually love that ( Cough cough Elder Scrolls cough cough)- It's anoying when you release a game, you get 1's and 3's, and when you do the thing (forgot the name) to see what was wrong, it only tells you stuff you already know!! So you will never know what made the game so crappy.- Sometimes, you do some combinations that makes sense, but the game says: NOPE!For example:Spy - Strategy Really? That's not a good combination?Still. Really good game, you gotta check this one out."

,"Posted September 27, 2015.",,264710,No ratings yet,True,"I love this game... Graphics are amazing, awesome mechanics, scary creatures, beautiful enviroment, A TON of variety (itens, places and creatures), awesome vehicles (PS: there's a seamoth, submarine and they will add a MOTHER ******* EXOSUIT!!!! YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WALK ON THE MOTHER ******* GROUND OF THE MOTHER ******* SEA!!!!!), lots of cool tools (stasis rifle, terraformer, seaglide, heated blade knife, etc...), you can explore the ship, you can build GIGANTIC unde watter bases, with observatories, rooms, docking port (for your seamoth) and decorate woth (almost) whatever you like...

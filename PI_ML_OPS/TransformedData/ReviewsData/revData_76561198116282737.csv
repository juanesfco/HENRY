So, of course I bought it the day it came  out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic.Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too!FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)"

Honestly, I don't know what most of the reviewers were expecting- it's a GRASS SIMULATION GAME.  Even so, it actually goes above and beyond just being a grass simulator. Of course there is the grass simulation mode, which is genuinely relaxing with beautiful music and soft, relaxing sound effects. It's perfect for relaxing after a long, stressful day.If you need more excitement, there are several other modes which have everything from dancing disco cows to the ability to shoot things to a snowy exploration level.As a fan of simulation games, I genuinely recommend this game. The devs keep adding new things and it definitely gives you a genuine grass simulation experience."

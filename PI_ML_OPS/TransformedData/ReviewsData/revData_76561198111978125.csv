However, despite the sheer awesomeness of this game there are a few problems which i will address : -playerbase/multiplayer wait timeThe amount of time untill i find one player is beyond insane. Prior to buying lethal league i looked at the amount of players present and to my suprise i saw 600-700 people, i thought well, since this is primarily aimed towards multiplayer, the amount of players should fine. A few minutes later i reassured myself and bought it. After the totorial of lethal league i did not waste any time, i decided to play my first lethal league multiplayer match.........It took ages, but then a guy named Squaresx5 saved me from my misery, i pounced in joy breaking my chair in the process. I was so happy, even though i was a noob and knowing that i will slaughtered. -Replay valueI know the time i accumulated is trivial which results in my review being little to no significance, but from first sight, the HUD, the menu and so on i seem to be getting the same message all around the place. CONTENT? REPLAYIBILTY?  but dont get me wrong, it is immensely fun and a good time waster here and then, after awhile though... it kinda loses the appeal, hence people leave. This problem will ultimately affect the player base and the overall longevity of the game.Stuff to consider adding in the future:+stats+stuff to buy and enhance. new abilities?, potions?, weapons?.+faster multiplayer connection+new maps and new characters+new modes+and events+leaderboard?Personal ratingAudio: 9/10Gameplay:8/10Creativity 10/10Graphics 8.5/10Overall a solid  8.875/10 The review written was not to stop you from buying this game but only to inform you of the amount of improvement needed. In the end, i bloody oath ,certainly,absolutely reccomend this game to everyone. "

But on the flipside skill animations are well made which i believe deserves credit.Still it is a game that is worth investing a few hours on, like 1-5."

,"Posted December 1, 2013.",,238960,No ratings yet,True,"This game is one of the BEST F2p games, hands down.It offers unique customisation and a huge ♥♥♥ passive skill tree.Once played you will be so addicted no other games can ever compare with this; unless you rage quit becuase your to lame to get past a certain diffulculty. You will want to play it all day non-stop and guess what not a single cent spent; though you can buy in-game items purely for cosmetics or if you want to boost you stash tabs or simply just support the devs. To end, just play it and you will not be dissapointed. Click, download, Playyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyand also spend money to support the devs."

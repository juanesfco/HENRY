This is a really nice game with really nice graphics and very relaxing music. After raging my ♥♥♥ off in Call of Duty cause of the campers and lag, I usually turn to this game. When I only want to play this for a few minutes I see myself spending quite a lot of time playing this. This is a very addicting little game that could be huge one day. This... It is really good for a Free-to-Play game. I don't even know why you are wasting time reading this review. Get it now!"

Now i have to pee in the bushes like when I go camping. I also forgot to turn off my computer. The power bill is going to be too much for us this year. And, I also left the hot water running back at home. ;("

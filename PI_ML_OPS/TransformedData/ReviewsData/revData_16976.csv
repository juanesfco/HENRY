Heartily recommend to anyone who enjoyed the playthrough and style of the 1st witcher, with it's dark fantasy, nihilistic choices and adult, not teen pandering storyline. I hereby name it The Witcher 2.0."

,"Posted September 23, 2014.",,33460,No ratings yet,True,An interesting game but not nearly enough play time.
,"Posted September 23, 2014.",,203770,No ratings yet,True,"Is that really how many hours I have spent on this game? I think the hours prove just how mind-numbingly interesting this game is once you finally understand how to play to it. Learning curve is big but, unlike Hearts of Iron 3 manageable and worth it."
,"Posted September 23, 2014.",,22380,No ratings yet,True,"The game is exceptionally well balanced and offers a long and complete story line. While it does surpass previous installments of Fallout, it gives it a run for its money."

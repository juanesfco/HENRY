Nazi zombies, abortions, hundreds of references, fart magic, Mongolians, Mr Slave so many things that make this game great! The turn based fighting is actually fun and functional and a lot more then you would expect from a South Park game. 9/10 exactly what you would expect and more from South Park."

Also a gamepad is a must as this has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard controls and using a controller is much more enjoyable even when I can feel my eyes getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed up by this game.

With all the combos, fatalities and overall violence this game has to offer this is definently a game I would recommend to anyone who is into fighting arcade games."

Huge world, many loots, much like.Massive PvP game, never trust anyone besides your real-life friends or friends on steam.Easy to level. Decent graphics.8/10 - When you die, you lose your ♥♥♥♥, your guns, ammunitions, resources and level except for your hat-wear :D           Servers usually screw up, you can't login to any servers, it'll just force you out but they'll fix it."

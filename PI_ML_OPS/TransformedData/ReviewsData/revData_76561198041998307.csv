Holy ♥♥♥♥ what have I done with my life? I have got to say that Team Fortress 2 is good. Not the best, not the worst, just good. I would recomend it to anyone who would like to get something new out of a FPS. Yea overwatch is a thing but TF2 is not going anywere any time soon. It's also free to play so thats cool I guess."

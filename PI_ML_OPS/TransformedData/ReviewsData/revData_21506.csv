This game also has incredible replayablilty making you just want to keep playing it over and over again to either get better, waste time or find all the secrets. Another outstanding fact about this game is how much it makes you question what sort of person you are, will you do your duty to your country and do as they request? Or will you let in people who want to get in to escape their horrible past? Overall this game is definetly a 9.5/10 from me."

The gameplay used in FTL is unique in terms of it's style and how it is delievered you'll be aiming at different rooms in enemies ships, using different tactics to destroy your enemies and all around different scernarios you'll be walking right into when in battle The game all togather was put togather and was delievered way better then expected, you'll have fun in terms of stragety and laugh at a few little easter eggs the game has hidden away I'd say buy the game and have a shot you'll more then likely fall in love with it's style and mechanics! -9.5/10"

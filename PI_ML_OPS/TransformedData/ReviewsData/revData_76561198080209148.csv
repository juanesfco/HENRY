You can make a rocket ship that explodes into a million golden flaming genitalia of doom, or you can fly around in a hoverboat entireley constructed out of wood and television sets. My favourite thing to do is spawn a mob of zombies, and whack them all over the head with a ♥♥♥♥♥ that is conveniently merged onto a drill. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to do something that their parents would not actually allow you to do. Like the above examples."

,Posted March 8.,,300,No ratings yet,True,"This game's community is very unlike other multiplayer shooter's communities.Unlike any CoD games, and unlike TF2, this game does not really have any 5-9 year-olds playing.The community is made up of people who want to have a good time, and want others to have one too.No one in the community claims they had sex with your mother.The community just wants to tell of stories of their personal lives, or discuss current events.Buy this game.The people are nice.oh and its pretty fun, too"

,"Posted October 9, 2015.",,271290,No ratings yet,True,"9/10 would- get my shoddy PC rekt by graphics- Get blown up by surprise butt-hole missiles- wonder why its free- get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because I'm not rich enough to afford better mechs- get my shoddy PC rekt by so much action- wonder why strange blue tiles are blocking me from flying out of the map- get blown up because my framerate ranges from around 10-25 fps- spend most of my time in the air, avoiding getting shot down by surprise butt-hole missilesagainI recommend this game to people who have patience, a good PC, reasonable download speeds, ping that is below 100, and if you like penguins.And mechs, i guess"

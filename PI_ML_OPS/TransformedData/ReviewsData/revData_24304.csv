Garry's mod isn't just a sandbox, it's a first-person shooter, a zombie survival, an obsticle coarse, a war-zone- if you can think of it than it's there. Personally i don't like sandboxes but this games is everything you could possibly imagine. You can kill your friends, make new friends and kill those friends too. You're only limited by your own imagination. The possibilities are endless."

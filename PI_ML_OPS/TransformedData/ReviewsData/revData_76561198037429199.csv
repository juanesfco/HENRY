The fact you have to download mods just to keep the game stable might put people off.10/10 ign great game other than the crashing but there's mods out there to make it more stable. (I recommend Script Extender and a save game mod, one of these seemed to help stop mine from crashing.)"

,"Posted January 25, 2012.",,91310,No ratings yet,True,I reccomend it for people who like killing zombies and RPGs. The side quests make the game go further but you don't have to do the side quests. Takes a while to complete but an excellent game!
,"Posted December 30, 2011.",,24960,No ratings yet,True,Great game for people who  like tactical type of games.

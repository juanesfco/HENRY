,Posted January 12.,,391720,No ratings yet,True,Some of the jump scares got me really good but the whole time i was amazed by the beauty of everything. I feel robbed not finishing that 5th part after what happened with the ceiling. Did it again just to take a moment and look at it all. Eagerly awaiting more8/Shia

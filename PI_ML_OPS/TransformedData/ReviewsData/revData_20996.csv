,"Posted December 18, 2013.",,261030,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,I recomend this game to lots off people because i think that it is a stunning game. you will be feeling like if you were there. i hope that you will want to buy this game and all of telltales games because i think they can work together with skybound to do even more awsome things to bring into gaming. overall the walking dead season 2 has had the biggest upgrade iv'e ever seen compare both games and you will see the improvment. like cod blackops 2 than cod ghost. i highly reccomend this game to everyone that see's this review.

,Posted August 21.,,379720,No ratings yet,True,Best Demon Genocide Simulator Ever.This game while not worth at full price for the lackluster multiplayerThe Campaign on the otherhand. Oh my prepare yourself for the most brutaly gorest metal game you will ever play.With Vulkan you can easily push 144fps with a mid range and higher setup at 1080p. So this is how you play DOOM the true way-Select Ultra Nightmare -Classic DOOM ViewRip and Tear until it is done.Quick tip: Do not ever stop moving.

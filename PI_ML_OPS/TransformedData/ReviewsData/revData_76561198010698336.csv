Its like a historicly accurate skyrim, with multyplayer PvP, and some kingdom management mixed in. it has a nice modding community, an exelent combat system, probably the most fun archery ive ever seen in a medieval game, probably the BEST horse mechanics ive seen in a game, and considerably bad graphics.... with a few bugs, and things that SHOULD be in the game but are not (not that most of these things are easly fixed with mods) the game itself is an 8/10 but if you mod it a bit, you can make it a 10/10. please forgive my spelling."

If the Elderscrolls 6 is this good, or even better.... They are going to make so much money off it that they could BUY the MOON!!! If you havent played and loved this game, then your life is meaningless."

There not free more like 'free to work'!!! if you PAY for this ♥♥♥♥ you might acctually have some fun kicking other peoples asses, but if you dont pay then expect to work your ♥♥♥ off for everything. This is not the WORST MMO thats 'free' but its certanly not better than a single player game."

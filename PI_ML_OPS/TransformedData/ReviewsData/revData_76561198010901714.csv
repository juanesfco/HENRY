,"Posted July 19, 2012.",,24240,No ratings yet,True,"A seriously fun game. Love the concept, this game requires team work and proper communication. Tactics, timing and precision is really necessary. This isnt your ordinary shoot'em up game! Highly recommend buying this with friends and playing with them."
,"Posted June 27, 2012.",,94000,No ratings yet,True,"Interesting storyline but not really a game more of a movie (20-25mins), buttons do absolutly nothing to progress the story, audio will continue as scripted regardless if u press a button or not.  Game playthrough footage can be found posted online by others, your better off watching it online than buying this as there is only one ending. However if money or value doesn't concern you then by all means purchase and support the developers."

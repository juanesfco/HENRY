The game flows so well, and is pleasing to look at. If you enjoy games such as stepmania, or audiosurf then you will love this game. It helps to improve your hand-eye co-ordination and reflexes.All i hope is that they might add a multiplayer function, so you have have fun with your friends to see who is the best at what songs ;3. 11/10 - IGN"

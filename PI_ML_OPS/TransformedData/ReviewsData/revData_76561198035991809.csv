More like bend you over a desk and ♥♥♥♥ you while taking your money and is basically the next Infestation Survivor Stories, this game has not changed since release, Its just truning into a money grab ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of broken promises and lies. Ive even had one of their customer support members admit that the dev team has been cut down to a very small number and then tried to back it up by saying 'Oh but they will work hard to deliver the best gaming experience they can'.... so mirco transactions and basically doing ♥♥♥♥ all apart from taking peoples money. good job guys like give ya self a pat on the back!"

Only negative aspect is the sometimes annoying quick time events which the game uses in action sequences.Over all i give this game a 9/10 true stroytelling master piece"

,Posted June 26.,,468410,No ratings yet,True,"The Bootleg rifle: Massive magazine, medium rate of fire , medium damage, low acurracy, medium stability, low concealment, medium threat.                   This is basically a smaller lmg, which is great because you get to use iron sights and don't have to worry about movement speed as much, while still having the room clearing potential, the accuary is rather low to begin with but can be easily modded to increase to a reasonable amount.                              The Anarchist perk.                 Replace some of your health with armour, regain armor from killing enimies. This perk deck is great because it can essentially let you become a'mini tank', being able to have heaps of armor but still being really mobile.                The Wing Butterfly knife.        Pretty average melee, same stats as most other knives but has a awsome charge animation.                Sydney. I love this character, i know people might find her high pitched voice annoying, but i like it. Maybe it's because i'm australian but i don't mind the accent. Easily my favorite female heister.             Overall the sydney character pack is probably one of the better character packs out there would reccomend."

Not only is this a great game but it led to the creation of many more like : Counter strike, Team Fortress and many more which are now there own titles all with future versions. If you don't want to buy this game at least get Black Mesa, a free fan-made version with updated graphics."

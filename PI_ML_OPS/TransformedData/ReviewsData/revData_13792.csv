Don't buy it for 97 Australian dollars, It's just amped graphics all in all. Feels like a rather meh, 30-40 dollar game at best."

I could write quite a large essay about this game, so I'll leave it short.10/10, absolutely astounding game."

Once Australian servers are released, and the characters have been balanced, I see this game having a bright future. However, it would seem as though crafting will allow for pay to win... The micro transactions within this game are its only current downfall. I'd reccomend the developer take a good, long hard look at their current monetary scheme, and rehaul it. Something like LoL's purchase system, or maybe like Dota 2's set buying system, chest unlockables and so on.. Regardless, as I said, with proper balancing and a dedicated team, this game could easily become a great moba. 9/10."

For now, I am super content with the variety, and realism involved with surviving within the world of Project Zomboid! Keep up the good work!"

It relies too heavily on cheap jumpscares and sudden hordes springing out of nowhere that you can't fight. The textures are also lacking in some areas, and the ingame menu is terrible. Other than that, not much to gripe about, I enjoyed it. 7/10"

There really isn't a downside, actually, scratch that, the only downside is that the world is not entirely-open, and I wanted to swim all the way to Skellige and get eaten by some Kraken-Esque beast. Either way, this was a beautiful way to end the trilogy, and I really don't think CD Projekt Red could top this game, but I can't wait to be proven wrong. Bravo. Perfect 10/10. You will not play a better RPG game, to date."

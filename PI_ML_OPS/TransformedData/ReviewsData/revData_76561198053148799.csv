Cause we are PC gamers ;)Also think before you hit the ESC key xDPorting aside the game it self is still pretty great in my opinion. The characters are great for the most part and I enjoyed the story. Also this version comes with Japanese dabb :DThe big drawback on this particual entry over entries in the seires is its linear nature.Would recommend if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a bit of tweaking."

I really enjoyed playing it with my partner, and I particularly liked the style of minor/major quest lines.  it was enjoyable and spread the game out so the main quest line didn't advance too fast.  However, it unfortunately became monotonous fairly quickly and the lack of any 'shiny loot' other than newer guns lost my interest.. I do look forward to those awesome purples etc"

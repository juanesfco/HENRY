,"Posted December 20, 2012.",,212700,No ratings yet,True,"Highly reccomended. Puzzles start off easy then go right to the hair tearing until you remember 'Oh wait....i can just use THIS sin!'. word of warning, some of the boss battles are irritating. one hit kills irritating. also those who don't want to pick this up because they don't want religion shoved down their throats (myself included) trust me, the game doesn't get preachy. you can pretty much swap out the theme for anything so don't worry. also reccomend grabbing a couple of xbox controllers and plug it in for some old school 2-4 player co-op."

,"Posted October 1, 2011.",,36630,No ratings yet,True,"I waited three days for this game to be downloaded. As soon as I started playing it, I realised that it was TOTALLY worth the wait. if the graphics aren't a deal breaker, the gameplay will definatly seal the deal. A must have. (a FREE must have, i might add)"

The gameplay is solid, and even though it doesn't really have a lot of maps yet. I'm looking forward to seeing big things for this game."
,"Posted April 9, 2014.",,9900,No ratings yet,True,"Don't download this game, it WILL, I repeat it WILL suck all your time with it's solid gameplay, great graphics, and nice story line.  Every mission felt like a Star Trek Episode, which is a plus seeing you could do what they can't do in the show. download it if you want a boredom killer for a long time (Trekies would feel at home)"

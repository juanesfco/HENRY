It combines the traditional strategy game approach of conquering one's allies with other more intellectual ways to do so such as cultural, diplomatic, science. Multiplayer as well as expansion packs such as gods & kings and brave new world, add new depth to the game and further inhance the experience of the game. Overall this is a must have for all strategy lovers and gamers alike, no game of this age surpasses it in its intellectuallity and fun factor.9/10"

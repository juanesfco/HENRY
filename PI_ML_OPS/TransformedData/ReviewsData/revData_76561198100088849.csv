At first, going to a server MAY tell you you are a noob because your a F2P ( I Find It More On Servers ). Well, YOUR NOT GONNA GIVE UP TO THAT RIGHT?! So Buy a Hat, Show it Off, Fight, Dominate, Join Tournaments, Play with 500+ Robot Attackers, Defend, Trade, Duel. And Ofcourse HAVE FUN!99/1010 Stars9m LikesThumbs UPThats all i got"

Its a perfect combination of Minecraft And DayZ.The Weapon Crafting and Skills were a good idea and the cars are good for a horde escape. Im finding 'Unturned' fun actually and I play this with hamachi.Im suggesting to open up some servers or create a global connection. Wish this game can have better graphics and make all tools can be used to kill zombies (Like the hammer, chainsaw, axe, etc.).All I can say is this game is awesome as hell and I suggest to play it. Its still in beta/alpha but still this game is good. I wish this game the best of luck."

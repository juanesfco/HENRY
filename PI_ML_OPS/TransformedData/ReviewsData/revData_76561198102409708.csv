If just to load a chunck takes around 30 seconds and by the time its loaded you would of probably died from an enemy hitting you and you cant do anyhthing back because your stuck loading. This gets me so frustrated when the hour quests are on... Getting from dungeon to dungeon takes way to long and I am usually a few points off the reward when the time runs out or get disconnected.As I said this game has a lot of potential but just remeber you will get frustrated from lag.

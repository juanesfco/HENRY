,"Posted November 20, 2015.",,109600,1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful,True,A game you can play on your laptop and even have parts you can do on your mobile such as crafting which is cool.Easy to jump in and play solo for a bit level up or two and then log out easilyEasy to play - just follow the pixie dust - although its good to take it off so you can just explore on your own. The only bad point I have come across at the moment is with the companions and horse as without grinding for hours and hours on end they only other way I can think of to upgrade them is to pay - even though I already paid at the start and found out after all my money had gone. - Note though if you buy a companion you dont need to pay to level them past 20

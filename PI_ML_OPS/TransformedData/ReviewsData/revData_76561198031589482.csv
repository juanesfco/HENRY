Graphic performance may have a slight issue even for high-end users, but gameplay overall is good. Scavenging items are fun to do as well, although the zombies are quite plainly boring since they don't move at all unless you get close to them in a few distance, or run. Many people thought that this game is quite hard to survive through the beginning but that's not true. The trick to play survival games like these is to play safe at the very beginning until you gain more experiences in surviving skills. What more, its free-to-play!The best tip I can give only is be a die-hard. Avoid cities/camps during full moon & don't take risks until you gained more experience. Nevertheless, always play safe.If you're also a minecraft user, give this a go too!8/10 Would recommend everyone to try this."

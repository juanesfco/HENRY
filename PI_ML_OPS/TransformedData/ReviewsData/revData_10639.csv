This game is what DayZ should have been, the gunplay is fantastic, the crafting is deep and immersive and most importantly, the community is fun. never before have I been able to have amusing and lengthy conversations with other armed players without beig shot at. In conclusion, if I had $50 to spend on DayZ and Rust, I would buy two copies of Rust."

If your not, its still i cool game to drive around and set up the playsets you couldn't afford as a child in game.If you were able to afford play sets as a kid and you still show interest in this at the very least you can support the devs."

From my experience its extremley hard to join a server properly, so the only reason to buy this game now is to give the devs more resources."

If you get bored or you have finished the game you can download DLC some of them are 'Dragon Born' and many more that give you new items, achivements, storylines, and more ablities!One of the best games that is fantacy with dragons, trolls and much much more!In conclusion i truly recomend this game-Lincolndb"

So I may be taking  a break from csgo who knows.

,Posted February 6.,,240,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"This game has surprised me before I thought it was bad so I didn't get it and now I just tried and I am in love with this game.Suprisingly It nearly reached the level to counter strike global offensive besides the graphics,year and different  game modes.However this game is very casual like Team fortress 2.If you have experience in Csgo and CsSource will be very easy as they ar pretty much the same.However this game might need to improve a bit in the model of how you play.So in my opinion I think this game should be a must have for casual players not sure about competitive.So thumbs up I reccomend this game"

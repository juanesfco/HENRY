,"Posted June 10, 2015.",,346110,No ratings yet,True,"i really like the game but there are a few things that need improvment such as the optimization and the fps, also the rate your food drops (not so much the water) but i found after i killed a few dodo's i was fine.also maybe try to make the agro range on the raptors a little less because if one spots you HOOOOOLLY crap yor goinna want to run.but all and all its not to shabby and there are a few bugs but its only in early access so i cant wait to see what changes are to come :D"

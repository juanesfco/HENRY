,"Posted October 25, 2015.",,8850,No ratings yet,False,I was surprised by this game to say the least as I just couldn't get into it regardless of how much i wanted to play something bioshock related...maybe its because your a big daddy but i can see where people will like it but i'm just gonna have to stay away until I feel like giving it a shot again.

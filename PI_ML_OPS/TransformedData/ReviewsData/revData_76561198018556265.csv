With a combination of action, thriller and emmersive gameplay, as well as enviromental challanges (Jump physics). This game will really put your eyes to the test, can you see the enemys before they see you? Cause their are so many!This is the second level of the killing floor, I quote bill LF4D 'Son we just crossed the street' But in reality they only moved up an elevator level on genes. What has yet to come as the game is slowly realsed with thrilling and horryfing creations, But who really cares, Let's just blow it up, I invite you to get on the GODAMN KILLING FLOOR, LET'S SHOOT ♥♥♥♥♥ES AND GET PAID! RAHHHHHHHHHHH!"

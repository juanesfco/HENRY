It takes alot of dedication to get to the assault class u want to play as whether tank crewman, fighter pilot, paratrooper, or a recon sniper, it takes a long time. The only thing I dont recommend about it is you have to buy into the classes then buy back into infantry. Also that u have to repair your tank or plane or u cant use it and if u dont have enough to buy back into infantry your stuck and cant play at all."

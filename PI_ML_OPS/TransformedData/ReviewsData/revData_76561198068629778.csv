,Posted February 4.,,394320,4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,just ruins the game for example heres one of the issues this unrefined dlc has brought. If you want to play as an ethnic minority like the dutch stuck in west francia and you want to break out before the patch/xpac you could just focus on finance and save alot of money to buy a mercenary army that take them down while they are weak.however with the new fleeing system and how hard is it to chase through francia with all the provinces being so small you will beat them in a battle but get much less victory points and they will be able to flee much further and if u catch up to them while they are fleeing you cant fight them which is absolute bs and just unfair nonsense. tldr some people like playing as the dutch and u made that harder paradox.

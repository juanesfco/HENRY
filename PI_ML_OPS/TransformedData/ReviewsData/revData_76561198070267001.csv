WHICH IS VERY SAD. Many Pros got banned beacuse noobs report them as hackers.The company is awful, why even if ebola and aids had a baby it would be better that the company.Dont ever get this game, Why even my game crashed many times and i had  the 5th latest GeForce grapics card. I swear this game shouldnt even be on the founders dream/ so screw this game.(If you dont know what it is its about a anime girl with a d1ck)"

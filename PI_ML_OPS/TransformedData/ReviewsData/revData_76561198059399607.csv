The 1.4 hours i have in game is trubble shooting it to work. and i searched online for about 2 months for an answer to my problems and i have yet to find one. My compute specs are just above mimimume requirements and i still can't run it. I wish steam allowed my to refund the $89.99 that i wasted on this game before it was realised. I really like all the ACU games before this game. Atleast those games can run normally. Hopefully the next game will be much better then this game.

The levels are to extreme for normal portal players, I needed the help of the guide on some parts of the game mostly the begginging. The ending was dissapoainting not the best boss fight.I hope they have another game as 'her' being your enemy.Total score 8/10"

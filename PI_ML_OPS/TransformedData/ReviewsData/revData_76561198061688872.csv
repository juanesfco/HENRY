It is slowly turning back into the mod and all its greatness. The game is good, but the devs... not"

He shall pay for this, oh crap, be right back, my drill is broken.11/10 would repair drills again.But truely, this game is amazing, some people say it's repetitive, but theres a lot of ways you can do things, One thing i recommend about this game (apart from buying it) is getting a mod called hoxhud, it really improves the game in lots of ways. compared to PAYDAY: The heist, this game is amazing, theres heaps more heists customisation, and all out fun! BUY IT FOR THE GREATER GOOD! spelling is good in this review...Edit:It's all fun and games until they add microtransactions"

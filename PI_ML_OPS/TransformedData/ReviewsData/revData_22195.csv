Fochi 2014 slopestyle. through sweaty fingers, a grimace of pain and a 78th attempt, i was finally flying gracefully off the last hump, tailgrabbing and crossing skis like an eagle. As i landed the almost impossible crossed ski double-rotation tailgrab, i couldnt help feeling like i had just nailed the unnailable.then i was rocket-blasted of my skis and sent sailing over a stunned crowd, coming to a halt with a broken neck and dislocated limbs as i smacked face-first into the cold, unforgiving ground.and every second was beautiful.Every. Seconddo your self a favour and come break your limbs with all of us, for the special introductory price of $10!Snow. Where people break bones. Together."

Nothing remotely memorable about this game, or praiseworthy.  There is a very good reason this has a 4.5 out of 10 on Metacritic user reviews, this franchise of 'games' is a joke and has been for years. This game and the company that supports it clearly appeals to autistics and 13 year olds that have no taste in games. Did I miss anything?"

,"Posted June 23, 2015.",,214490,No ratings yet,True,"Absolutely fckn amazing! 10/10. Games are not made with this high of quality anymore. Possibly the scariest game ever conceived, another win for Indy games over bs like Fox who cannot make a decent Alien game to save them"
,"Posted March 12, 2014.",,230410,No ratings yet,True,"Very fun, addicting, fast paced competitive play. Class-based combat and plethora of classes at that. Still in beginning stages of the game and not even fully developed, already is showing itself to be a most promising game. Free game that actually strays from the 'free to play but you have to pay to win' mentality, can't wait for it to be fully realised!"

,"Posted January 3, 2014.",,238960,No ratings yet,True,"Solid Action RPG, fast gameplay with fun classes and massive talent trees, and its free! Quite a big community as well, highly recommended for fans of Diablo 1 and 2."

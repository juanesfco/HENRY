,"Posted September 19, 2011.",,22100,No ratings yet,True,"Mount&Blade is an open-ended game in the same vein as Darklands or Elite. Theplayer takes the role of the leader of a wandering band of soldiers andwarriors. The player then sets his or her own goals, whether they be of amercantile, heroic, or tyrannical nature. To accomplish these goals, theplayer will engage in dynamic and deep combat using everything from throwingdaggers to military picks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. Basically it is a snad box game that can be very realistic. You can LOSE battles. It is not just a button masher as far as combat goes, there is strategy and skill involved in the fighting. Graphics are ok as of version 1.011. I like that you can do whatever you want. Roam the land killing bandits, solo if oyu like. You can amass a huge force of soldiers. If a kingdom you are friends with is under siege, you cancome to the resque. Or you can take over villages, towns, kindoms castles. You units know what to do and do thier best to carry out your orders."

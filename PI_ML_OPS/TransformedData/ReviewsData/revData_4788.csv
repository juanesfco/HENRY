The pure amount of content and design, especially for a game as old as it is, is delightfully abundunt and results in hours of conquering, raiding, and slaying foes. And marrying. And fighting in tournaments. Only the stuff a true Calradian warrior would do and then some. Also the looters and raiders have the best one liners in the history of video games. All in all a great purchase. Would recommend 10/10"

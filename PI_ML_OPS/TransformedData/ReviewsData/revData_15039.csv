Gotta love being noticed once in a while.Also the game is an amazing gore-fest for any shooter fans that want to dismember things.But mainly the aussie love."

A free game better than many Pay to play titles, very commendable.Support those who don't crumble to petty demands."
,Posted February 8.,,336310,No ratings yet,True,"This is the definitive pack for you to get, if you wish to both support the developers, and get an overdose of gems at less than half of the normal price. The added benefits really flesh out the experience (especially if you're into aesthetics) and give you a bounty of goodies.Its also a really decent price for a 'free to play'. After buying this you felt like you bought everything you needed."

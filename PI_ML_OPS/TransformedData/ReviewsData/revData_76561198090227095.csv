A great mixture between FPS, Strategy and Horror, Depth is a great game to play with friends or solo. The atmosphere of the game is great, with the enviornments and gameplay making you feel alone in the vast ocean which is actually really terrifying, especially when your heartbeat picks up when you have no idea where the shark is. Definetely a game to play with headphones in."

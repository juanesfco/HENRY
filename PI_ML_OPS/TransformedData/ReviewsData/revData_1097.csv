This happens once, you think oh well try again.  After the tenth time you finally get jack of the game and move on.If developers are going to create a game with Perma-death, the golden rule is the only person who can kill the character is the player and their choices. Not glitches and bugs.Sorry but I'm moving on."

,"Posted August 15, 2014.",,22380,No ratings yet,True,In my opinion Fallout 3 is one of the best games ever made. New Vegas continued the concept. What's not to like.Instant classic!
,"Posted August 15, 2014.",,274310,No ratings yet,True,"One of the most frustrating games I have ever played. So much promise but I cannot stress highly enough, do not start playing this game.  If you do, many hours later you will finish it and be as irritated as i was."

,"Posted December 11, 2013.",,220240,No ratings yet,True,"So far my favorite game of all the games i have played. Great graphics, story, gameplay. All 3 things needed to create a great game! Much more, if you are a fan of open world games like me, this game is perfect as well by adding a large area, caves to explore, and missions to finish. Customization of your gear makes each fight unique too. From a super stealth gear like the bow, to an extreme killer like the AMR, there is barely anything to make thsi game better. Another addition to the game is the scene. Beautiful islands, waterfalls, mountains, it's really does give you the feeling of you being on a tropical island! Finally, the wildlife, there are various different types of animals seen on the game like crabs, turtles, tigers, leopards and the 2 most heart pounding animals, the crocodile and the shark. Nothing like this game, nothing to compare it to. Best...Game...Ever."

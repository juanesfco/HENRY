,"Posted August 7, 2015.",,244930,No ratings yet,False,"Challenges don't work, events also don't work. Don't even get me started on multiplayer. Freeroam is just bad in general and the game is badly optimized. Not worth money not even worth the time of downloading it. This is the most broken game I have ever played and even quitting it caused it to not respond. I feel sorry for anyone who put money into this piece of broken crap. Don't buy it for the love of god."

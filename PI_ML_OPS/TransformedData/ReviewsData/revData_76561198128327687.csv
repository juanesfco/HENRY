,"Posted April 13, 2015.",,218230,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"Planetside 2 is a Sci-fi MMO shooter with three factions fighting over a planet's resources and territory with many classes of military such as light assault, heavy assault, medic ect. if you have friends (the more the merrier) to play with you can create a squad and work together as a team. But overall it is fun if you comit a good amount of time and have a good squad you can have the best organised chaos in a MMO game, i would defenatly recomend Planetside 2 (it's free)"

At this point, Steam Early Access release, the game isnâ€™t finished in its full vision - instead we are given a fantastic early access release. It is incredible that at this stage the game feels and plays so good and the amount of content already available in the game.This is how a early access release should work. A great experience, demonstrating the core idea(s) and a roadmap to continue development.I have played Project Reality, that mod for Battlefield 2 where most of these Developers cut their teeth. I played that mod from 2007 up until this year and I am excited to see what the Squad Dev team can do with this game."

We the players put in a petition for them to port the game for us, and they listened. We should be thankful. Having said that, I had no problem running the game on Win 8.1 Pro with GFWL without installing any fixes and mods. Saves, game resolution, MP everything worked like it should.Oh, and if you can't handle a hard game....a game which doesn't hold your hand to jump across puddles and doesn't teach you how to swing your 5 foot long subway bun, then this game isn't for you."

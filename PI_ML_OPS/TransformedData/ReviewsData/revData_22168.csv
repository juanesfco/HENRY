Great game 10/10

,"Posted September 20, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,True,Awesome Game just needs more productive things such as fishing etc need to add planes and boats that are workeable and this will make the game better add dedicated servers and so far 8/10 beacause of some glitches and when u try to join a server it says timeout that is annoying anyways good game still needs improvement

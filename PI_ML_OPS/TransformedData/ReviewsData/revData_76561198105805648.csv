Provinces can now be truly customised since the have reworked the province wide effects of building allowing vast amounts of income to be gotten from fully developed provinces, this somewhat makes up for the lack of building slots available in each cityinspite of the bad precedent of mini campaigns the first two released for this game are actually worth playing,CiG in particular will require strategy to win.This game is not what is shown in its trailers(to be fair what game is?) but it is a worthy total war none the less"

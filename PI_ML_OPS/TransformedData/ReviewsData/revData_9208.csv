,Posted May 14.,,440,No ratings yet,True,"I had so much fun playing this game. There were only a few hackers, but at least it isn't as bad as *cough* CSGO *cough*. The community is alright and overall its a thumbs up."
,Posted May 14.,,413410,No ratings yet,True,"I may have been late for the party, but this game knows how to keep things interesting and engaging. I love all the characters (except monokuma) and it's challenging. Love the game. Recommend it."
,Posted May 14.,,730,No ratings yet,False,"What was once a terrific, skill-based and popular first-person-shooter is now a piece of trash. Every time you join a server, there will always be ~2 hackers. After playing this for +1500 hours and suffering wraths of toxic hackers, you ought to save up your $15 USD for a better first-person-shooter. The dream is dead."

,"Posted September 25, 2014.",,273110,No ratings yet,True,"Now I know what your thinking, OMG its a horrible version of Counter-Strike 1.6, but actually its not bad at all. Sure there are swarms of bugs and issues, but its a Beta, so expect loads of improvments when the game becomes an Alfa."
,"Posted July 13, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,True,"The game is quite intense when it comes to finding food, water, ammunition, fuel and medicine in order to survive. I like how you can drive cars and run over zombies and animals with it. I like how guns can be customised with scopes to increase accuracy. I like how you can even farm for food, so you don't have to go out and hunt for food. However, I find the zombies to be a bit OP, but once I build up my items and weild weapons they're not much of a threat. Just make sure you check your surroundings before you open up your inventory, I almost died doing so. So should you download and support this game? Definately!!"

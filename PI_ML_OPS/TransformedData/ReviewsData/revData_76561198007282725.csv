(Source: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521) However, he openly admits that the incentive behind the Black Market update (the update which introduced microtransactions) was money-based. The success of PAYDAY 2 has also changed Overkill for the worse and diverted their attention and focus to money rather than support. Not only has Overkill shamelessly defyed their own promise and introduced microtransactions, but these microtransactions  BOOST STATS . I've supported this game despite the overflow of DLCs being introduced every month, but this is sadly the last straw, it is much to the community and myself's chagrin to see game with so much potential to decline like this."

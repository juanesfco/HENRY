Even though it can be a bit repetitve I found it quite fun! The two things I disliked was the keyboard/gamepad because really in all honesty, you need a controller & the other thing is the voice chat in multiplayer. The voice chat is forced and you can't mute people or turn it off. Other than those complaints that I have, it is a very great game through & through. I like how it covers the first season of the Anime and some content from the Manga. Great Game"

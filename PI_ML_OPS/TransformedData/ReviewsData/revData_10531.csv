GG Overkill.Feel free to do a 360 on this and impress me, but untill then, this game is a DLC saturated P2W piece of ♥♥♥♥.EDIT: Well ♥♥♥♥, they did it. Not a full 360 mind you, but a solid 180.EDIT 2: After giving this a second thought, ok maybe it still isnt a very good system.EDIT 3: after 6 months, the game is mostly back on track and honestly better then it was pre-microtransation update with alot more free content being released.EDIT 4: Microtransations made a relic and only avaliable on the steam marketplace. Paid case drops removed ingame. Awesome!"

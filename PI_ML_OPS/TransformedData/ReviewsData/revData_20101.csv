It is my favourite Saints Row game to date and I fell that they balanced the silliness right in this one, it had it's serious emotional moments C***** dying and had some funny stuff in it too like the pimp slap etc.This is some of the most fun I have ever had in a game and if you are good at finding fun things to do in the game it will enhance your experience even more.I give this game a 9/10"

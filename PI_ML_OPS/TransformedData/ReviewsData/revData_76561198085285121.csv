,"Posted July 7, 2014.",,72850,No ratings yet,False,"at first this game was fun and awesome ton of stuff to do now before all the fanboys eat me alive i want sya somthing i had the non steam version for a while i lost so i got the steam one so i had about 500+ hours on my non steam version so i know what am talking about but there are some good things+ modsalmost all the bad things can be fixed but i am the 3% of the gamers that play the game 100% mod free atleast until i have done the games  storyline, after i had done the game i put some mods on the game and i loved it and so many of them were lore friendly +graphics the game look very good better than oblivion plus mod can make it look better - walking walking walkingi hate games e.g like pokamon cos you walk every were!!!!!!!! without being attacked by somthing and the horses a too slow - lame combat it feels so lifeless yes the animations are cool but it so annoying and the enemys god it is like they are made of steel and it gets more annoying at the end when you know your weapons should be more than enough to kill your enemys - lags and loading i don't have a $3,000 high end PC but it can play most games but god it lags alot and even if it just me i know that that the loading screens are TOO LONG!!!!!-being evil i am going to say this one time if you kill half of white run and all you have to do is pay a fee of stay in jail for a second and after that no one seem to mind that you just killed every thing in site 5/10 sorry for the bad english i am part aussie and mostly mexican"

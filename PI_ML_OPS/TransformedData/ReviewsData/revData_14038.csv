,"Posted May 28, 2015.",,218620,2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful,True,awesome game my favorite aspect to the game is the music all of 'em are good. lots of DLC's are cool too but the only bad thing is there is a lot of updates which is bad for me cause my internet isn't that good so it takes a while but other then that its a amazing game and you should buy it ok mate?

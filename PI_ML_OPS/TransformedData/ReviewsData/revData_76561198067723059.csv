,"Posted November 29, 2013.","Last edited July 12, 2015.",570,No ratings yet,True,the best games i have played so far. I live in Australia so i dont comr across Russians and such as frequently. Alot of people say the commmunity is toxic and i would have to disagree. The most toxic people i have come across are people in Low Priority which is probably the reason they are there. But if you cannot take critisim the i recomend NOT playing this game.

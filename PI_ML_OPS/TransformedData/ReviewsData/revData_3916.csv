Navigating your way through the menus is a lenghty task itself, aswell as the introduction of many new skills and attributes. One thing that stands out to me personally is that there is no quest marker. I thought that this would make me annoyed but it infact dose the opposite. Having to research about what you're doing or where your going is something you dont often get in modern rpgs. Morrowind is perfect on so many levels. Story, enviroment, classess and choosing which adventurer you want to be."

It is a blast to play with friends and even by yourself. L4D2 has loads of achievements and these play a great part in the replayable aspect of this game. However this game does have some downsides such as backtracking levels and infinite spawns. I would recomend this game to any person who loves to shoot zombies in the face and have a good time doing it.8/10 would play again.
,"Posted July 17, 2014.",,400,No ratings yet,True,Something that Portal does that stands out to me is the villian. GLaDOS is up there for me as best video game villian of all time along with Vaas of Far Cry 3 and Handsome Jack of Borderlands.

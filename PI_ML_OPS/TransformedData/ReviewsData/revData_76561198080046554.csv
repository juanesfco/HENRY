,"Posted January 31, 2015.",,91310,No ratings yet,True,One of my favourite games. Engaging. Highly recommend.  Have not played Co-op yet so cannot comment on that. Also  I used to have a headset (razer blackshark) with 3.5 mm conn. for speakers and mic and the sound was fine but with my new kraken (a USB connected headset) I cant play the game due to an extremely loud static in the right side. Have to use speakers or nothing.

In this game you can die as many times as you like. You can also respawn as many times as you like free of charge! So if you reeally like dying, and you reeally like respawning this game is for you!!All jokes aside it is a fantanstic FPS MMO."

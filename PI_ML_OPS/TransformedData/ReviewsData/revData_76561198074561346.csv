,Posted April 29.,,311690,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Enter the Gungeon is a roguelike, top down shooter, similar to games like The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne. Each level/floor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms, combat rooms, secret areas, and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor. The game is perma death, meaning when you die your run is over for good, adding a bunch of challenge to the game. Gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets, and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen. These make the game a bit easier.There are many many different guns, buffs and active and passive abilites, allowing for heaps of potential synergies. The game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns, and references to other games/tv shows etc.Overall this Enter the Gungeon is really fun, but it can be hard and frustrating at times."

Meeting up with friends and building bases is good as, and it feels really satisfying to get new gear. The only bad thing is it crashes like 3 times an hour, but it is alpha so ye."

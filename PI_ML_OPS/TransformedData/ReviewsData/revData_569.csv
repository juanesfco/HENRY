Getting yelled at by my friends, Hiding offline, but it was totally worth it. There are so many things you can do in this amazing Open World RPG. At the beginning you can create your own character, which is kind of cool. There really is no ending to this game. You can play at your own leisure. Besides getting yelled at by friends and the case of the removals, this game is worth the money. If you ever get bored and/or beat the game, there is an excellent collection of mods at the workshop and a website called nexus mods. This game is highly recommended to anyone who is into open-world games or rpg's. But one last thing, as soon as you get the game, you cant stop playing it."

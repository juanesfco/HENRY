The bosses are actually a fair bit easy, once you know it's moveset.You may die. Your mind may be ♥♥♥♥♥ mercilessly and you may rage quit multiple times...But you'll love this game even more when you triumph over those annoying bits. Get this game now."

Iron Keep is bright as all ♥♥♥♥.Dragon shrine is easier, but once you attack one of the dragonbros, R.I.P you. Nothing in DLC is changed, sadly. Except the key placements.You get Grand Lance so ♥♥♥♥ing early though..GG WP FROM."

The fantasy game I was in love with before Dark Souls crawled from hell and took me into it.I recommend this, but use mods to make it infinitely better.It's good, just that there's no real and true bosses. But it's so ♥♥♥♥ing massive in exploration and quests, holy ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, get this game and the DLC. It's pretty good. (Although I prefer Dark Souls..)"

It's like shitcraft (Minecraft) but with more weapons, armour, bosses and it's 2D. It's really fun in multiplayer, but it's hard to do because of connection things.I recommend doing it solo first, then play with your friend who is also as experienced as you for maximum enjoyment."

You can become a Majin, a Human, a Namek, Freiza race or a Saiyan.Online's alright, just a bit laggy.   That's what I get for being in Australia.  I would recommend this game to people who are at least kinda familiar with the story, as things change due to the darkness from Mira and Towa, 2 of the few new characters introduced to the series. The DLC's are pretty good, you get new abilities and characters Revival F DLC doesn't have story mode. ;-; Also, watch Team Fourstar's gameplay of this game on YouTube or their website. Hail Dumplin."

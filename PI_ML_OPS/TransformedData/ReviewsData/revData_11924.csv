,"Posted December 21, 2015.",,203770,No ratings yet,True,"Played a game with my friend as Navara, he was the newly founded Portugal, we worked together to take out all the sand ♥♥♥♥♥s in the area. After that we turned our attention to Castill who had recently ate up Leon and most of Galacia. We knew Castill would dominate us militarily because we went on heaps of crusades and had defended against many muslim jihads thus our army size was greatly reduced (I had a levy of 1000 vs castill's levy of 17000). Castill declared war on me and I knew I was going to loose, however all was not lost because my son was somehow heir to the throne of Castill–three years later he died of 'suspicious circumstances' but all was not lost because I had another son in line for the throne–who had also suffered the same fate as his 13 year old bother. I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by this stage but I still had one more son who was originally third in line to the throne of Castill. And yes he was also assassinated, by then I didn't have any holdings to the throne of Castill but at least the last assassination revealed the culprit of these untimely and convenient deaths and it was no other than the King of Portugal himself. 10/10 would end a friendship again"

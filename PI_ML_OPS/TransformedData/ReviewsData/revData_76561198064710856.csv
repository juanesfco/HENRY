,"Posted July 7, 2015.",,252490,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Owned my server and played  1002 Hours on Rust now called 'rust legacy' compared to the new & improved  'RUST' I call it rust detrimental it has ruined it for all rust fans. The new 'RUST' is nowhere enjoyable 'some work & some don't..?in question it's totally screwed to allow a transition like rust to completely switch from good gameplay to looking for a barrel for a couple of hours.The gameplay may be smooth but that's about it.I could go on but consider the so many fans out there who still like 'rust legacy' im sure your one of them..keep on keeping on.P.S. Will have to update my server...really...not

Farm for life as new content is released every so often that you want it (also for rank system). If you have money you can buy ♥♥♥♥ right out otherwise good luck farming for life. Game has so many bugs that when you report it , you either never get a reply from support or if you get lucky to get a reply back you will be told its a client issue, nothing else."

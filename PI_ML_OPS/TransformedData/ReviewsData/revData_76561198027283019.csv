,"Posted April 4, 2013.",,8870,No ratings yet,True,"BioShock Infinite is one of the finest works of art to come out of the gaming industry. With its breathtaking visuals, immersive and quirky world, addictive gameplay, and with an unrivalled narrative that grabs onto you from the very start and never lets go, it's easily one of the best games I've played. BioWare has previously been known as the leaders in storytelling with Mass Effect and Dragon Age, however Irrational Games have not only taken over the mantle, they've blown the competition out of the water. Do not miss this game for any reason, and prepare to have your mind blown."
,"Posted January 4, 2013.",,203810,No ratings yet,True,"Never has there been a better example of art in a computer game. Dear Esther is one of the most unique and interesting gaming experiences of the past decade, and easily one of the most beautifully realised locations ever, made especially impressive by the fact that it was done on the now old, Source Engine. You don't play Dear Esther, so much as you experience it, you explore an island to the sound of a fanastic soundtrack, meanwhile a narrator slowly tells you a rather cryptic story laced with deeper meanings and metaphors surrounding a major event in his life. If you can survive 2 hours without the need to shoot, stab, or loot something, then Dear Esther is not to be missed."

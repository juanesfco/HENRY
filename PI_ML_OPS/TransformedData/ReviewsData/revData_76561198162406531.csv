,"Posted October 13, 2015.",,376870,No ratings yet,False,"Minecraft: Story Mode doesn’t feel like a Telltales game. It feels like a cash-in. It feels like Microsoft threw a big beefy contract at Telltales and said “Just do the usual”.At first glance it may look like the usual fare: an impressive ensemble cast and a heavy lean on comedy but in actuality they've taken some big names, thrown them into a mixing bowl and hoped for the best.Some of the Actors are dreadful and either don’t understand voice acting or have had terrible direction. The plot - or as much as I absorbed - isn’t very interesting.In a lot of ways it’s similar to existing Telltales games but instead of an engrossing story with memorable characters it’s a waste of effort on the developer's part and a waste of time on the player’s."
,"Posted June 1, 2015.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.'Where do I start?' This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm..._The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more._Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore._Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds._Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want._My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8.5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod"

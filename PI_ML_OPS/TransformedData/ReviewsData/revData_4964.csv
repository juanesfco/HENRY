This is mainly when i'm trying to be stealthy but i turn around just to find a ♥♥♥♥ing mutt ripping my face off.OH GOD I JUST HOPE THAT MY GRAPHICS CARD IS FAULTY, I AM GETTING A NEW ONE AND IF IT STILL GETS THE RANDOM LAG, I WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DECAPITATE MYSELF.Oh, and I recommend the game."

I was hoping to find out how many children had banged my mum. But no luck on this game. :(You need to play this game to enjoy it. (Logic 101)And finally, 5 plus a day, that's the healthy way."

It's only in alpha stages, but it's epic.Surviving with friends, pvp, (kitpvp servers are a must play!) or just plain survival, no pvp. Like minecraft, you can have 'mods' except these mods are more like bukkit plugins. You can find servers with economy, pvp arenas, teleportation, door sharing, kits, and because it's in alpha stage, you're bound to find some really funny bugs. Like when you shoot somebodies head, it stretches out and usually their bodies go flying. Anyway, i recommend this game to everyone, and especially my friends who used to play minecraft."

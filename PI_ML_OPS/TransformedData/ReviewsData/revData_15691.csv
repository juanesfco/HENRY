,"Posted December 6, 2014.",,209650,No ratings yet,True,"I'll give this game a 9/10.-One of the best C.O.D's I've played so far. Yes it has FPS lag on a few maps like Defender or Instict but only for a minute or two,after that the game is fine.-The new Exo-Suits give you to do things that you couldn't have done in the previous C.O.D's.Like for example dont you hate it when you get shot in the back?Well with this COD you just Boost Jump your way out of it!-There is a fair aresenal of weaponry that you can use in the game,with new weapons like the MORS,RW1,HBRA3 ect. with some old classics like the AK12,MP44 GRACH (Pistol),Bulldog etc.-You Can now prestige 15 times not 10!-This game is heeps of fun with some friends in a private,online match,or just on your own playing online!-Storyline is AMAZING!-Bunch of new gamemodes like Uplink,Momentum Etc.-I Really recommend this game!

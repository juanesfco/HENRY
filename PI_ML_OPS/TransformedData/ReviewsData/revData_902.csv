,"Posted February 20, 2014.","Last edited July 21, 2014.",105600,No ratings yet,True,"Amazing game.Perfect for anyone bored of minecraft, i got about 50hrs solo out of it, another 60hrs on a friends server, another 50 or so after 1.2 patch came out. Keeps getting better and better, the sort of game you can come back to every few months and have another 30-40hrs of a completely new experience.EDIT: 1.2.4 came out = another 50hrs"

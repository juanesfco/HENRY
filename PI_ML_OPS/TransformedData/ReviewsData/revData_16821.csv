I love the new hacking system & the ranged hacking mechanics. This game was as interesting as the first. Must Buy/Play. Although I kept crashing at some places, all I had to do was change the settings to lowest :P. Still got creeped out. 11/10"

,"Posted July 9, 2014.",,17300,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Crysis is a sci-fi fps game. It's pretty good but my only complaint(s) are that this game has to many bugs/glitches ( TAC gun not locking eg.) It is also extremely irritating of how insanely impossible some parts are in hard mode.Ea has once again released an unstable but good game.7/10

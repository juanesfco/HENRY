,"Posted April 25, 2013.",,223710,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"i remember playing this game every tiem i play it with family and friends they get all depressed but when i play it by myself i get emotionally, and mentally traumentized and when i beat it my best friend had to have been put in a refinement center. lol NO I'm joking for teh lulz. It has some nice puzzles, the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital, and you could learn more about the development of the game via it's website or by unlocking the director's commentary. For example, ruMpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on map/level design. This game has at least 4 endings, but I will not be a spoilering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tell you about all of them. However I think ALL of the endings aresaddening, because just this once I will be an inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Simon the Main protagonist kills himself. If there are secret endings, I hope I can find them myself The combat system is nice, it forces YOU to choose what to use, IE: A baton, a shotgun, and finally a hunting rifle. That was just an example of one of the combat loadouts. Speaking of combat & gameplay, there is a multiplayer mode with it's own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find Simon. However, somehow, you share the same hellish relm with our crippled David Leatherhoff in a grey hoodie.I recommend this game to fans of the 'Silent Hill' series, the 'Resident Evil' series,'Left 4 Dead' series, and finally to everyone that has played, beaten, and enjoyed the half-life mod, 'Afraid of Monsters'."

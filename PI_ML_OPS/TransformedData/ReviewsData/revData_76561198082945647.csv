Big intense battlefield action with Third-person and guns, lasers everywhere. All you can see is detached arms and legs with heads flying through the air. Also with big piles of combinations that you can use to make your weapons shoot faster or make it stronger or whatever. But anyway I rate this game a great damn10/10"

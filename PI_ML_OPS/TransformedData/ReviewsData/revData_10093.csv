As with my experience, you can only dig through the blocks and endlessly jump through the world. But I love cards.10/10"

That is not the case, however. It shows the true face of a pay-to-win game, it feels like the developers slapped me in the face for not spending a dollar on their market. A shame - that's what it is. It had great potential although the cash shop, overpowering your opponents by spending money ruins it. And no it's not me being bad, I'm great at the game, but you can never dominate a player who has the best in-game items, no matter the skill. Then it becomes frustrating to play, you will eventually quit it like I did so I beg you, spend your time on something else like TF2!"

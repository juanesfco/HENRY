A first person puzzle solver/thriller.The dark story and in game environment/music/events will more than likely give you goose bumps and you still wont be able to stop playing. It's cheap to purchase and I think it's a must buy for any gamer interested in this genre.The game has some aspects which are not at all obvious and I must admit I fell into the trap of referring to the steam forums for help on a few occaisions. Anyone attempting this game should seek some tips before starting but not spoilers (from someone who has finished it), and give it a red hot go without further help."

This game has the standard chose your own upgrades xp system which keeps it interesting.It can feel a bit slow at times, but there's always upgrades to be found and I don't think I have come close to maxing out the speed yet.The game offers a borderlands style mp where friends can join your game."

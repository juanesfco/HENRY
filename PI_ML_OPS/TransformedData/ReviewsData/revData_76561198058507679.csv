Yeah sure 40 dollars is alot to ask and pr is in a better state but the graphics on this create a really realistic atmosphere that PR fails to recreate. This is a game you can sit for hours paying and never get bored from the tactics you make and teamwork you use. Just some things to consider before buying, make sure you can run it. Besides that a really great game!"

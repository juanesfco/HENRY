You don't HAVE to use money to be good at the game, or to buy overpowered guns/classes, you just gotta play the game, get money/coins/currency and buy them (although it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to grind the cash) Played it for a short time and already it feels like CoD mixed with CS: GO, and I love those two games so it's a 10/10 would play (and maybe even pay for) again!"

I use mine over wireless ac and get the same performance as being physically connected. The controller is a new and wonderful exprience but awesome to know that can I either plug in a different controller or go back to KB and mouse.This is most definately the answer for the PC elite who would like to engage in some couch surfing without having to shell out for a console that they would otherwise have to purchase games for in addition to their existing Steam library.

Still fun but not as good as the day it was released - they're trying to over complicate a simple concept. No LAN support and they control all the servers. This advice stands even if the game is on sale."

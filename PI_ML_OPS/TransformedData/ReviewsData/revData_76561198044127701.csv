,Posted July 8.,,105600,No ratings yet,True,"Ever wanted a game that is fun, has decent graphics and you can kill as many bunnies and birds as you want? Well this game is for you, in terraria you fight against giant eyes, mutated worms and cthulhu's brother. And, Yoyo's are the best end game weapons (trust me). I give this game 9.99 for all of it! Just watch out, or the zombie bunnies will come and get you while you trade......"

Its old engine utilises only 2 cores which means that quad and octacore cpus suffer.Even on high-spec machines, this runs at sub-40 fps, and still drops in high density areas.Your gfx doesnt even matter, since 90% of the rendering happens on the cpu. Despite this, it still looks garbage and the animations are laughable.Basically, this game will never run well on hardware unless the engine is changed, which judging by the appauling progress of this 'early access' will never happen.Buy this if you enjoy unplayably laggy games or enjoy wasting money on overhyped underdeveloped games."

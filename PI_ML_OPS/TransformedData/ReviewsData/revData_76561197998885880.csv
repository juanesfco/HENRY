Terrible money hungry devs - What an embarrassment of a title on steam. Each and every person involved with this mess should be ashamed of themselves. AVOID!!!

Game loading & regular crashes, bugs - You name it. They're all mostly here still and it's an insult to be frank with you.Don't waste your cash on this, It's not even worth the $3 it took to upgrade during that 'special' promotion.AVOID"

The music is soothing and the levels get better as you progress. I'm ashamed that I didn't pick up Hexcells sooner!I highly recommend this game to everyone, even those that aren't into the genre. You will not regret it."

There is no tutorial or campaign; you learn everything yourself as you progress and you simply move on to the next puzzle upon completion. Some would argue that this isn't their style, in fact most would, and that's fine - It's not for everyone.I really liked it though and look forward to playing the next game the dev releases. Good stuff!"

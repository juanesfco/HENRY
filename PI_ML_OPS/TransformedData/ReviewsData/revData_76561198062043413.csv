I've only played a couple of hours of this magnificant beast and i can already see its amaizing potential! The gun mechanics and weight of your character and his ability to sprint overwellms me. The gun sway and recoil along with the puffing of your player as he is tired of running make some incredible gun fights and wrap the game up superbley. I would easily say this game has the potential to be one of the best games of the year, and its only an indie game! Absolutely stunning game, please. If you have any spare money, BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"

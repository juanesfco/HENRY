It kinda ruins your playthrough. This gem really needs to be polished more in here for good classic Custom FPS game.PS: I already tried the complete mod as well and other advices but it still doesn't seems working. I kinda had an issue everytime I trade with npcs. Still is there any advice for this issue. Any advice would be much appreciated.

,"Posted November 4, 2015.",,206190,No ratings yet,True,"Gunpoint is an amazing game, chock full of thoughtful puzzles, an interesting storyline I did not expect to like as much as I did (which was a lot), memorable characters, witty dialogue, and the jazziest, snazziest soundtrack I have ever heard. 10/10. Would punch a guy 1000 times for an achievement again."

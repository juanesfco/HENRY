This is a really detailed game so if you have 5 bucks go buy it and if you liked it get season pass ep 2-5 for 16 bucks thats what i did. 10/10

I've soloqued about 3 times in the past week and i've won 2/3 of them and the one i lost i was qued with tollers. If you play with friends (i would recommend a full lobby) it makes it a lot easier to win if your teammates are good.Over all i would give this game a 8/10."

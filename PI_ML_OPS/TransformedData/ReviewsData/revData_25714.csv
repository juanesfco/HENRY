But to people that don't have money and rely on gift cards this games is pretty terrible. No not the game play but the new match making system (which is to throw you into a ramdon game) is pretty ♥♥♥♥. Lately I see a block with a wheel  and a little gun vs fast, deadly  one shooters I'm pretty new to this game I played long ago and kind of stopped but my friend show me this new update and how awesome it was I got back into it and the first game I was invisible? Not sure what you call it but fix that. Plus crates I got a epic in a silver crate and got two commons and one wheel in the purple rare one."

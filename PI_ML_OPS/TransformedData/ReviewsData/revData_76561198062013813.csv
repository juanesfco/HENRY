Think simulater,RPG & RTS so if your into (TES) the elder skroll, (TW) total war or a realistic game then this is for you. You can command troops in battle but at the same time you can take matters into your own hands. Theres plenty of costomization in turms of armor in (MBWB) mount & blade war band & fire & sword but I should say the (NW) Napolionic war lacks the single player element but if you join a (REG) regment then your multi-player alone will make (NW) worth it so I give mount & blade an 8/10."

NOT TRUE in 3 hours of play I do 3 battles.I'm not saying don't buy it cause there are some good features like Sparta getting good CAV, the Spartans look Badass & now other factions stand a chance against Sparta thanks to some balencing. It's not bad it's just not what I hoped for... 6.5/10"

So far I've had a smoth run, with no crashes, texture bugs or glitches & I'm 9 hours in, the only problem I have had is a slight FPS drop now once an hour, but nothinbg that makes me want to stop playing. It really feels like a Batman Arkham game, there are so many things to do & I wana do them all!!! I would write more in the very positave reiew but I really wana get back in to my game.8.5/10 fantastic!!!!"

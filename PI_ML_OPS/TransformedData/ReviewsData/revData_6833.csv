,"Posted May 17, 2014.",,265930,No ratings yet,True,"Remember all those hours you spent as a kid, dreaming of being a goat. The smell of the grass, the fur, the horns, the psychopathic rampages and complete destruction of your surroundings? The devil worship, the anti gravity, and the murder of people and other goats. This game brings your childhood fantasy into reality. Kill, crush and destroy your way through this goat heaven(or hell)."

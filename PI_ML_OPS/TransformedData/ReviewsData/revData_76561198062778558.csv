,"Posted March 9, 2015.",,220,No ratings yet,True,"The game that spawned a legend. Half-Life 2 spawned the demand for a sequel like nothing in any form of media has ever done before. An amazing game, with Physics and Graphics ahead of its time, and the occasional puzzle to think over. It really combines elements of an FPS with puzzles and story. A must have for any Gamer."

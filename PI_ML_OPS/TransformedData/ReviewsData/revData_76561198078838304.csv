,"Posted August 11, 2015.",,242800,3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful,False,This could have been a great gameI bought this game less than ten minutes after launch. The graphics looked alright and the idea seemed great. Unfortunatley the devs decided not to optimise the game at all and skimpped out on basic animations I.E attacks are always the same from the evil demon people and theexplosions would have issues. after the game was optimised though it proved a pleasent experience. the grapices setting the same i had more than a 40 FPS boost and could play with more than 60 frames. Unfortunatly the animations are the same and the crafting system can be useless. I wish the devs good luck wih later games but please make the launch better and the mechanics work.

,"Posted December 28, 2015.",,225540,No ratings yet,True,If you LOVE blowing things up this is the game for you. In Just Cause 3 you play as Rico Rodriguez (a man with a reputation of breaking the chains of opperesion) with the goal of overthrowing dictator Sebastiano Di Ravello. To do this you must cause chaos by liberating towns by destroying propagander and destroying military infustructure. If you like the idea of that then this game is for you. There are some grapical glitches from time to time. But these are being patched.Overall I give this a 9.5/10 for great fun gameplay and new and improved mechanics.

There are guns and flying and a variety of large maps. The one thing I like most is that you can play with friends (duh). I highly recommend this game to people who like flying, shooting, multiplayer and playing with friends."

This game has an action-adventure genre with some puzzles. I think this game is pretty much like Uncharted. It has puzzles, action and adventure. This is a computer version of Uncharted. I recommend this game for people who love action and solving puzzles. I would give this game a rating of 8/10. Hopefully episode 2 will come out soon."

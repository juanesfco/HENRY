,"Posted December 21, 2013.",,47410,No ratings yet,True,Seriously... not bad.  Harder than required without IGP but with careful play even US$5.00 worth of 'Crowns' can give you that kick-start.  In the Southern Hemisphere I'd advise loggin in at least TWICE a day.... action happens while we sleep and players in Europe and USA far exceed Australian and New Zealand / Pacific Rim (SE Asia) players.So basically... you snooze... and you'll probably be obliterated.... and don't take time out as the game runs in real time.  Fail to log in for two or three days and you'll be reading the chapter on 'What happens If I Lose My Village'....  Ans:  Makes it harder to win!!!!Cheap and entertaining for RTS players (reminds me of Age of Empires II)

Nothing's as scary as getting ambushed by zombies while searching through an abandoned shack for food.' Boy, this couldn't be more of a lie. It needs to be changed to, 'A zombie game that's truly about profit. Nothing's as scary as being bug hit by a half in the ground zombie who walked through the closed door, whilst you try to pick up a bugged out rotten kiwi."

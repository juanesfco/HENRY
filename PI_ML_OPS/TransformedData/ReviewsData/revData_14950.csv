Really fun game, and multiplayer aspect of it is well done for an early access game"

Love the comic style graphics, the co-op mutliplayer aspect is fanatic, and the replay value is phenominal (single player is good but you get better items and rewards the more players they are, increasing and supporting the multiplayer aspect"

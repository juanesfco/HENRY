I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.Essentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.The graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.The physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.Once again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved. In final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get. You're in charge of your own wallet here."

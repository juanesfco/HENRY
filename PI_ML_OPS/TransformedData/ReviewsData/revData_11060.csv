The way the game is burning with tension when remaining fluid is as equally impressive to experience.It does have it's flaws with pacing and the gameplay is not that deep but it is as deep as it needs to be and everything else more than makes up for any shortcomings. You will remember this game and you will feel immersed.Alien fan or not, you will get pulled in..."

You read, you listen and you pry into the family's personal mesages and belongings.But Is it fun? I don't know. It's like a wierd loot simulator where the payoff is crude questions about social pressures and expectations.And that's it really. Themes of lesbianism and general suburbian troubles.It doesn't lead to anything significant either. Everything seems to distant to have any impact. Perhaps, if the subject matter was of more interest or imaginative, this 'interactive experience' would be able to have more impact on gamers. It's hard discovering you're a lesbian, I get that, but for a story-based game with a weak story, there is nothing really here.Play Dear Esther instead if you're curious, unless you know a lesbian.  3/10Ps. Why give access to a microwave and fridge and not let me cook anything? I wanted beans. Not cool."

It's got a reputation for being punishing but you will quickly learn to love the fluid combat and solid gameplay design. I remembered what it was like to not have my hand held by game developers.All other RPGs will never seem the same."

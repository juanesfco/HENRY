Developers are getting back on track releasing new content and patches monthly. Definitely recommend trying this game since it's F2P, but be warned it does take some time to get used to and will leave you raging most of the time. I advise you watch some Youtube tutorals, Wrel has a good channel and will give you an in depth explanation of many aspects within the game. As long as you are patient and willing to die a lot, you will have a great time."

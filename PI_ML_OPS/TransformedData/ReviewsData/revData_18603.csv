,Posted April 27.,,353370,No ratings yet,True,"Definitely the best controller for PC games.However there's still some problems, most noticeable while I was playing Lords of the Fallen.1. Not enough buttons2. Very easy to mistakenly press the left back button (X1)One suggestion: 1. Add buttons around the joystick and the top-button area - thumb and index fingers can definitely handle more buttons."

It feels hollow, much emptier than when I first started.I checked other reviews, and I understand why. The feelings seem mutual among other early backers.Better save your money for No Man's Sky (and hope it doesn't suck)"

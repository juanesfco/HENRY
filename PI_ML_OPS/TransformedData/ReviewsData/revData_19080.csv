With mind bogglingly strong boxes you'll be holding down left mouse click for hours at a time, you might think this is a 'boring' or 'mundane' concept HOWEVER with the literal piles of zombies swarming you constantly said mechanic becomes truely delightful.Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies also has majestic boss battles with original mechanics like 'constantly insta-killing you and knocking your weapon out of your hands' mechanics like these show that the video game franchise as a whole as grown and ascended past it's 8-BIT era."

Alrighty, I should be able to give you one, I've played this game plenty, just, not on steam.Granted, I've not played this game in quite some time, but there is one thing you must understand: Elite Moderaters. They are either going to be your best friend, or, they'll be some punk two year old, that is crying over the fact that 'YOU SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥, YOU'RE USING A DAMN SHOTGUN! GTFO!' with the message of 'You've been kicked out of the match by the Elite Moderater.' The game has a bit of a... History, with Hackers. I don't know if they've fixed that, but for some time, Elite Mods were Nexon's way to deal with it. MOST of the community however, if you were in a normal game lobby, dispised the hacker as much as you did, and wouldn't hesitate to vote kick his ♥♥♥ out."

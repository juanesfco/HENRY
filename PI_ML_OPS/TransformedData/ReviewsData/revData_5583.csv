,"Posted April 13, 2014.",,277430,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"This game is a perfect showcase of what a mobile port should be. The graphics have been amped up, the music score is incredible, the gameplay feels true and halo-like and all the dirty discusting micro transactions have been thrown out. Buyers should know that there are no micro transactions and thier is full controller support. Also the fact that this is single player only (with daily challenges to keep longjevity). Great game, sadly there is no multiplayer, buy it to show microsoft that we want Halo 3 on PC!"

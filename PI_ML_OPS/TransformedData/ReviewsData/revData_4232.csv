Join him in his epic quest to avenge his brothers who have been brutally butchered (literally) and eaten by a small town. Featuring intense gameplay like licking, jumping and random explosions this is sure to be game of the year for the next 15 years!"

Literally felt sick for about 1/4 of the game. Amazing ending and multiple choices well worth playing"

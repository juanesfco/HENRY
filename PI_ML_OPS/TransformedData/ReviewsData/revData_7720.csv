The game stays true to the 'survival at any costs' theme and very quickly becomes a race through the ranks until you achieve real weapons such as pistols and M4's"

,"Posted March 15, 2014.",,12200,No ratings yet,True,"Bully is GTA without the drugs, the sex, the deadly weapons or the murder. However, Bully is in its own right a great game. The minigames are fun and exciting and there is always something to do. The character, Jimmy Hopkins can be customized into the type of person you want him to be and no matter what choice you make the story will always look new and fresh. If you havent already, do yourself a favour and buy this game."

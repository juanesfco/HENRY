It has great mechanics and the classic, arcadey feel of 2D side-scrollers will hook you in. A wonderful RPG, its bosses and other sprites have a wonderful (and monstrous) art style that add to the feel. Its relatively new 1.3 update had a graphic overhaul and while Re-Logic have stated that no more major updates will happen, you can still enjoy Terraria in its beauty.I would certainly recommend this game to any fans of the genre and even if you arent too familiar with it, i believe you'll love it.4.75/5"

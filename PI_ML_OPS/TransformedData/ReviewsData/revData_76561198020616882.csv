Apart from small frame dips when in large areas, this game runs like an absolute charm for me, no crashes no nuffin! This game definitely feels like it has much more depth to it compared to its predecessor, and in its current form is well worth the buy IMO.Although I don't know what's up with this microtransaction B.S., it's highly unnecessary."

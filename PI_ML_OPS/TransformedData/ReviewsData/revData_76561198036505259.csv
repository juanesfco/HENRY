,"Posted February 28, 2015.",,325610,No ratings yet,True,"The best total war game as of yet, almost everything is perfect about this game. I do wish that the AI would stop razing every city they pass.(whilst im dealing with internal and local issues and expanding my empire, everywhere else is completely destroyed. Every city razed with only a few stragglers roaming looking for more, then there is no mighty empire for me to fight)"

,"Posted June 24, 2014.",,440,No ratings yet,True,"This game is one of those games where, its serious, but isn't too serious. With all the weapons and hats, oh so many hats, It is a game that shouldn't be taken seriously. All of the gamemodes to date have been fun, even some of the community created gamemodes and co-inciding maps. To end it, Fun, wacky, and just a plain good time."

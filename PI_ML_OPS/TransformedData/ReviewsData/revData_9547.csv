,"Posted November 27, 2013.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"Very fun sandbox, If you can think it... you can most likely make it.r The main problem is the online, although it is alot of fun, There is alot of young players who tend to ruin the fun for the more mature players.r most of the gamemodes are fun to play, i suggest starting with TTT (Trouble in terrorist town) Or Sledbuild (Players build sleds with anything, You can make beds to houses and RACE THEM!! :D)r Its a 9/10rA Must Get Game... It requires a game with the source engine (Half life 2, Counter strike source)rGet counter strike source with it. It contains all the textures and models for almost every gamemode."
,"Posted November 27, 2013.",,224260,No ratings yet,True,"Could use some updates and patches.rThe animations need work, The zombie animations are hilariously bad.rMultiplayer is fun, The 'Escape' modes are fun to play.rThe realism is immersive and scary at times (You need to check up on ammo, You can get infected, You can bleed and lose health quite fast at times)rYou can also barricade doors... Barricade... :DrOverall the game is a 7/10.rIts fun, Great to play with friends."

The new buyable and tradeable weapons skin are fantastic, adding more fun."

When shot you flinch crazyily it's almost hard to shoot them after that. Weapons spread is so high its amost impossible to hit the enemy. Spawns are also crazed as i spawn on roofs, near groups of enemies. 2/10"

I signed up for the beta ages ago within the very early stages of this game. When i finally was able to play i coulnd't, too many bugs and all. One major problem i had was mouse acceleration. Still not fixed to this day."

I have already clocked in over 30 hours in order to complete all routes within the novel, and I haven't regretted a single one. The novel can truly bring out all your emotions, and has constantly been engaging and exciting. The novel is really well made and the art and illustrations are fantastic, a simple masterpiece. Despite some spelling errors and English grammar mistakes. It really is a VS i would suggest to all those who enjoy anime, VS's, choices and simple reading. All the best in your play through!"

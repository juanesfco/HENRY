Starbound has a incredible power of make you just want to explore the damn universe. You can choose between 6 races, and they are perfect well chosen by the creator. The game stills in BETA test, and it is awesome. I imagine that game in the end, without bugs and perfectly ended, as a classic of the new 2D games. But I think that they should improve the storyboard, such as creat some items. But in general, I recommend that game for everyone!"

First the ambient of the game: completely inspired in cold war. Of course they couldn't use real names of countries, but it is obvious the relation with East Europe. Second, the power that it gives to you: you are a damn inspector. You can do what you want, deny or approve a person (but no without penalties). And finally the emotional situations that you live inside it. A mother that wants to see her son in the other side of the border, etc...A great game!"

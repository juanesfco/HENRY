No story or cutscenes etc. Robots just keep coming harder and faster and bigger, while you improve your weaponry and features.Control and gameplay are excellent, though still lacking in movement options like all fps games these days (can't move much while shooting; can't sprint and strafe).Weapon options are quite good. You start with a choice of shotty, assault rifle, battle rifle, and the weaponry builds from there. The middle tier weapon options could include a true auto smg, but it'll get there I'm sure. The shotguns seem OP.Anyway, jump in; grab a gun; shoot until you die!"

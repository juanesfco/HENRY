This game is very easy to get a grip of and get used too from so far that i have played, the graphics aren't the best, but what could you expect from a free game huh? but still the graphics and gameplay is very nice, i would rate this game so far a 8/10. And i would definately recommend this game if you have an intrest in WW2 shooters, have a somewhat decent PC (e.g. can run Minecraft at around 35-60 fps and a low budget."
,"Posted January 17, 2014.",,221100,No ratings yet,True,I have to take my hat off to Rocket this time (although it took them long enough!). This game is an execellent horror/survival/adventure/action game! but there are many bugs (i know its still in alpha) that can randomly happen. such as::zombies derping all over the place:lag when picking up some items and putting the in your inventory:(not a bug) REALLY WIERD CONTROLS! TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR TO FIND WHAT DID WHAT!:make textures load faster (in start menu):possibly make zombies easier to kill:MORE ZOMBIES (but not to many):make can openers easier to find:make blood transfusions easierthere's more stuff but i cant think of them. Here's some stuff you could add::a little russian translation book or machine (for signs):VEHICLES!:tentsbut besides that stuff Rocket has done an excellent job and has satisfied me and my expectations!BUY IT!!!

And the game in its current state gives justice to the legacy of Rome: Total War. Beautifully optimised, added features, fleshed out gameplay; its hard not to reccomend this game after the several months of transofmation it endured.This Regular Smokey Joe rates it about 9/10"

Polished gameplay and style is accoplanied by an emotionallly charged orchertral score which work to fully enthrall the player in the struggle of day to day existance. Get ready for the feels. 8/10"

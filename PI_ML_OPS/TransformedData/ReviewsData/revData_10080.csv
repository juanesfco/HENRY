I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an epic adventure involving dragons monsters and magic. You can sink heaps of time into this game. When you think your done, then how 'bout downloading some free mods to add to the experience, and rack up some more time playing this masterpiece."

There really is nothing better than loading up a casette of power pop and creeping around putting fools to sleep."

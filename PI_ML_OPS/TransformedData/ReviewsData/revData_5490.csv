,"Posted July 24, 2013.",Last edited January 17.,207230,No ratings yet,False,This game was fun at first in it's early access stage with developments and new characters back in 2013. But long time ago the developers completely abandoned this game since it wasn't getting very popular. All that's left now is some mulitplayer servers of the same game since it's abandonment. In addition the community isn't exactly a nice bunch either.I would not suggest getting this game at all at this point since no this game will have no more additions. Once you basically 'master' the game there is nothing to work towards to or look forward to.

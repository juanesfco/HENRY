Before this game came out I was looking for a city builder and couldn't decide between sim city 4 or the recent sim city. On one hand you had updated graphics and a smoother interface, and on the other it was functionaly better. This game gave me the best of both worlds!"

You need more food, but you can collect more between the 2 of you. My one suggestion is that you play with only 1 or 2 other people at the start and make sure you know them so they will co=operate"

Sure it can be boring with long as dialogue, but that's what to expect in visual novel games.Also, why does 'being a furry game' make it need to be hated? There are worse fandoms guys, seriously. Enough picking on the big fan bases, Especially the furry fandom and Major/Minor.Rating: 8/10 Hesk ButtsNote: This will most likely be the only time I actually be serious in my reviews, so let's say it's a 'rare occurance'."

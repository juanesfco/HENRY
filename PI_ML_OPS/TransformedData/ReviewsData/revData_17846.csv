The online play is slow the game is laggy and the big takiling tutourial head scares the living daylight out of you! I suggest turning the volume off as this game has the worst audio I have ever heard it's the same repeditive loop of the same thing. But I did quite enjoy the Idea and the carnage but it wasn't enough to save the game I would give the game 4 out of 10!"

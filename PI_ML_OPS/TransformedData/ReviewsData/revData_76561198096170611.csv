Sometimes the game can be hard. ( 7.8/10 ) *too much slow motion*"

Even after years of playing I still somehow find myself on this game, BUT, the bad physics engine can be funny, however, its very buggy and annoying. Crashes aren't rare either. The support is massive and thats what keeps the game going. ( 9/10 ) *too much water*"

( 8.7/10 ) *too many cats*"

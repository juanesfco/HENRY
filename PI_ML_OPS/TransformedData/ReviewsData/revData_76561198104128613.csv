Rail and Plasma are bit OP but devs are trying to balance gameplay with regualr updates. It has good graphics and a good community even though you might do ♥♥♥♥ at earlier levels. Was real skeptical and thought it would be P2W but isnt even though it has a similar system to de-dust where if u get a block destroyed you have to pay to build it again. However you get more than enough money at the end of the round to rebuild ur ship and buy new parts.Dont listen to anyone else. i made a ♥♥♥♥, a tank and an airship that worked."

I just survived and started running away before a child zombie pushed me into a trash can. I fell through the map and my computer blue screened. 10/10

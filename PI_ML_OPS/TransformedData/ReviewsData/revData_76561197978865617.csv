The program is very interactive and allows you to work and learn at your own pace.  It is NOT a competitive game, it is a program for learning about weapons and doing it in a safe way.  I have been hunting since I was 8 years old(I am 59 now) and have always been interested in various weapons, but would never be able to afford them or get access to them.  This is the next best thing.  I highly recommend this program."

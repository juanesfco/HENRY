,"Posted December 30, 2013.",,211420,No ratings yet,True,"This game,Is a gigantic piece of ♥♥♥♥.Enemies are so over powered, Rolls are slow, chacter is just some weak guy who dies in two hits, Requires alot of skill to do certain things. All things about this game really just don't play like Call Of Duty and should be patched at least 3 times in order to assure its made easier for my son to abuse other grown ups online.9/10 IGN SCORE.You should buy this game."

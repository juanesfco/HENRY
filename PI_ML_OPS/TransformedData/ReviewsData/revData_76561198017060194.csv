It's one of those games where you'll wonder 'was that the right choice' and 'did i really have to do that'Overall Spec Ops the line is a game i recommend it to anyone for its story alone it was one of the greatest story driven games ive played in a long time9/10. only reason it does not get a 10 is the controls are a bit annoying some times

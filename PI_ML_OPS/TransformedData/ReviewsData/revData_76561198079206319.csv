Unfortunatly that doesn't look like its happening soon. the game creators should probubly put this on a more stable platform (so to speak). but right now I can't say its looking very good seeing I can't get into the game without it crashing on the loasing screen. I'm sorry but it's my honest opinion and thats all they ask for. This game is  worth less than a defacation, your not getting game of the year award any time soon I can tell you that. I'm sorry if this was a bit brutal but its my honest oppinion. ET the game runs better than this. and thats the worst game in history. Sorry but its true."

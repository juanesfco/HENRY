A game designed to excel in all areas with one goal: making the player feel at the centre of the action and in control. From the original graphics to the enthralling gameplay - this game is definitely a contender for this year’s GOTY.The verdict: 11/10™[420]xXBadBoyHustlerXx[666-69]™'s Official GOTY Pick of the Year™

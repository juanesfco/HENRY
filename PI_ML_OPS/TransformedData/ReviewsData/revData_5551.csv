Including 100s of community made maps and such. However includes small aspects of teamwork which makes the game interestingCommunity: 7/10 - 20% of the people you will find are 7 year-olds who constantly brag about making boom-boom with my mum. However the other 70% of people you will find are wonderful people and great friends, constantly being friendly and showing newer players aspects of the game. The other 10% are ♥♥♥♥♥ :)Graphics : 7/10 - Customisable towards liking, however the highest setting results in a mediocre style look, however plausible with the cartoonish feel towards the gameStory: 8/10 - Good lore behind the characters once you investigate, including various comics which show the backstory towards characters, I also love the Meet The Class videos, which you can find on youtube, where you can find out the true personality on the charactersControls 10/10 - Fully customisable, which make the game user friendlyOverall - 8.5/10"

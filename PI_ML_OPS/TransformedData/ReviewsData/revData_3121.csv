If you have nothing good to say, then get out of this community, because that is the cancer of Spiral Knights.This game is just a simple dungeon crawler game with a lot of good mechanics. It might be irritating to play, but when you reach a high rank and you find the item that you need. You feel happy inside.I suggest actually giving this game a try. I have been playing this game from 2013-2016 (I quit for two years), and I always loved the game, I didn't quit because I was bored, I quit because I didn't have any time.I highly suggest this game to someone who has a lot of time."

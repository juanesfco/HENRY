The storyline is amazing as well as how the characters' personalities are shown through events in the episode. The artwork is very breath-taking and I just can't wait to play through the next episodes. Definitly worth the money and time. This is all from just playing the first episode and it just goes to show how much time and effort was put into making this wonderful game. Definitly a top competitor alongside TellTale Games, and I'm looking forward to what these guys make in the future."

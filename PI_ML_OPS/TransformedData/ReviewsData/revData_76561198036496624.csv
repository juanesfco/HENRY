Supergiant games does not disappoint with this stunning science fiction role-playing work of art. If you liked Bastion, Transistor should be your next purchase. Worth every cent."

Focuses alot more around mind-games and deception rather than 'kill and hide the body'.The role selection thing is dumb, doesn't give me enough time to think of a stupid name.Is good tho"

I could've gone out for pizza but instead I played this game for 4 hours.I'm jealous of Shoji and his stupidly good hips. Screw you, Shoji. You're hot. d:3c"

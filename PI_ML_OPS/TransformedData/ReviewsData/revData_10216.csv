It is also a type of game that has you thinking after the credits have rolled. 10/10 Best $10 I have ever spent"

You wont be able to put this game down untill you have completed all 3 difficulties that you unlock by completing the previous. only real downside is the huge amount of dlc that will seem to rob you from all your money. 9/10 hyped for the next borderlands game"

Walking through the ominous halls of the underwater dystopia known as rapture is one of the most memorable singleplayer expirences. 9/10 (would be 10/10 if it werent for the repetitive trivial hacking minigame)"

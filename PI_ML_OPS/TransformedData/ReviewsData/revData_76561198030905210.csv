There is a lot of variety in weapons and in the classes too, and all unlocked weapons are sidegrades. If you don't know what that means, it is an item that itsn't better it is just different. The maps are pretty good too and there are fun custom gamemode. AND IT'S FREEYou should really get this game!"

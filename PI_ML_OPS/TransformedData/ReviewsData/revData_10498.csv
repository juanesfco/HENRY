The grind in this game is too hard, instead of habing a fun time blowing up planes and vehicles, you spend hours upon hours grinding just for one tier 2 plane. The reason why i still play this game is that i love the grind, its very enjoyable to me.i would probably give this a 3/10 unless you like going on a grind for years to get every plane and tank there is, then i would give a 9/10."

On my list of best games played this year.Gorgeous stylized visuals. Gameplay is challenging and rewarding. Learning curve isn't too steep. (Normal difficulty is scary, I haven't tried the other options.) The screenwriting is excellent; the characters really shine through the writing. If you love tactics games and party management / Mount&Blade styled RPG's -- then this is a must get.Can't wait for future updates. Well done Overhype Studios. *Raises pint*What I'm hoping will appear: - Settlement management.- Larger maps / vast terrain.- Naval battles and interaction (Vikings!)- Female characters?"

(In comparison to the original Dark Souls ported controls.)- Fashion Souls!- More mimics.Cons- Uh... Not enough soup? Praise the soup!- Needs additional character interactions/story arcs.- Damn mimics...10/10 Sunlight Medals."

At first I was intrigued, but then I found out how much it takes away from the actual immersion. Weapon impacts and swings don't feel responsive. Eg. Characters never seem to have enough 'Oomph' in their attacks, as if they can barely hold up the weapon itself. The headshot mechanic is finicky and also not responsive (I may be wrong, but I found whenever I landed a decent hit to an opponent it would do damage, but not nearly as much as when you are poked in the face from a reeling attack from the opponent and are instantly defeated from it.)10/10 most unresponsive and difficult control scheme imaginable.Camera needs to be fixed, constantly becomes stuck on walls. Limited zoom option. I found myself hindered in combat as I constantly needed to reset the camera view whenever my character went too close to a wall. (A locked third person behind the shoulder/s camera position would have been far better.)Verdict: I would only get this if you are a very patient person and are willing to learn infuriating controls. Hopefully they can fix those issues."

Smooth.- Great soundtrack and audio.- Challenging gameplay -- Learning curve is not steep. Easy to learn, hard to master.- Memorable character design.- Huge replayability. Daily runs.- Radiation.- Mutants.- Maggots.- Airhorns.- Y.V.!Negative features:- Challenging gameplay -- Some of the bosses seem a tad overpowered at times.- Some characters and their abilities seem underpowered in comparison to others.10/10 thronebutts"

Sadly some elements of gameplay, particularly the reward system which differs every year, only helps to support and reinforce the toxic behaviour that plagues the majority of the players. All I can say is continue milking the cashcow Valve."

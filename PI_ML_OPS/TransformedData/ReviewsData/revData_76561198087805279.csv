It's really fun in sandbox because you can make whatever you want that involves half life 2 and other things. Also a great thing for servers if you want to play Jailbreak, DarkRP, sandbox and much more! You really should get it!"

The first starter mission is basically the tutorial mission, the mission that was avaliable in the beta.  the 2nd starter mission is a little more difficult and a bit longer. The main mission is the main mission of the game. It's a big map with a lot of different ways to finish the game.u should get da game. it's a good game."

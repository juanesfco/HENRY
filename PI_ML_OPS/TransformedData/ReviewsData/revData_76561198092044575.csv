Look at minecraft during alpha and compare it to what it is now. I definitely recommend this game and encourage others to support the dev team in building this game up and reaching beyond it's limits.

There are some issues that does ♥♥♥♥ me off at times but you have to remember it's still in Alpha. I can see lots of potiential in this game and no doubt it will be a success in the near future."

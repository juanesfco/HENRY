The only problem I have with it is half way when the Combaticons were combining it suddenly pause and became a green screen but I manage to solve the problem by skipping the cutscene. So yeah 100% RECOMMENDED

The community of this game is terrible and horrible and all other negative words. But by far a really great game. Just only play solo or close friendsDickbutt. Joined the gameDickbutt: hi guysVote to kick Dickbutt.? Yes Yes Yes YesYou have been voted off.

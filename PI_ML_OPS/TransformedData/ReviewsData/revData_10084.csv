,"Posted June 11, 2015.",,332970,0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,I am very disapointed with the fact I could not play this game. I was getting 1 frame every 4 to 6 seconds and It was unplayable. I have a 4 year old mac potato and this is the only game iv found that it cant run. But the game looks cool please fix or tell me what i can do to fix this. I like the game I just cant play it

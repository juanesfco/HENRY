Simple to play but really hard to master. Everything looks and feels very nice but the multiplayer could be better with the freezing but is fun with friends if it run smoothly

It's like Malaysian GTA with the great grapple hook and parachute combo and the whole point of this game is to blow everything up! It's like a interactive action movie!

The 3D races are enjoyable but I wish we could get something like the console version of the game ported to the PC.
,"Posted December 5, 2013.",,218620,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,Really fun multiplayer game! Well optimized and takes the best parts from the first game with now RPG elements. Only get this game if you have friends to play with because the bots are awfully useless. The game feels rushed with the levels (e.g. no 7 day heist) and the lack of safehouse customization. The game is great though!

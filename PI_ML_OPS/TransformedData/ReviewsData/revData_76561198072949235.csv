In all honesty, this game has a lot that has it going for it such as its story, art and uniqueness as a game. The story was pretty interesting, where you play as Sgt. Burden working to save the world. The pixel art style was a very nice touch to the game, I couldn't think of an art style more fitting for GWBW. Lastly making decisions that could ultimately make you die or survive keep the game quite fun. Nonetheless, like most games, it has its flaws. The lack of a quicksave option is one. Another is the replayability because you play GWBW for its story and/or gameplay. Pros:- nice pixel art style- interesting story- unique gameplay- has a nice pace, the story isn't too long or short- the game is overall well made- no bugs (for me)Cons:- no quicksave- cannot be replayable (atleast to me)- minor things such as characters sometimes placed too close to each other.Definitely a must play!I'd give it a 8/10"

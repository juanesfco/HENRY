You will have a hard time (50% of the time) invading a players world that isn't laggy as hell, many tiny little bugs that are too numerous to list (activley being fixed). You will breeze through a small portion of an area and think that you're doing great when somthing stupid happens (enemy hit you through a wall or a swarm of axe-wielding zombies attacks yoo) and you die... Again and again and again... And again. Neutral-You will die.Conclusion-Not worth the $80 (Australian) I payed, wait for a sale. But a fun game that I will be playing for a while. Don't get this game if you are close to sucide, It WILL push you over the edge."

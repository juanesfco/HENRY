There are some glitches every now and then, but they aren't really disruptive to the actual gameplay. You can create your own systems and set up  your own lobbies across multiple gamemodes. It runs smoothly on the best settings but I have a fairly good machine. Haven't played many games yet but it is one of my favourite games already. BUY IT!!!!"

The different scary, sounding monsters require are entertaining to destroy and each monster requires a different stratergy to kill. Enemies are tough when you play solo, that's why I recomend playing this game co-op with your friends for a much more rewarding and enjoyable experiance.This is why this game is a must have!ZIKOZ90"

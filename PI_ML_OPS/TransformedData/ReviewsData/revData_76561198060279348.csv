Or live long enough to be called a hacker; repetitively.Great game but one of the worst communities on steam.If you can put up with unwarranted hate, this game is definitely for you. Other then that, excellent game.9.5/10"

A harmonic combination of humour, strategy and excitement come together to form a must have game. Although Team Fortress 2 is nearly 5 years old, the FPS action never has a dull moment. I recommend that anyone interested in TF2  should download the game without hesitation."

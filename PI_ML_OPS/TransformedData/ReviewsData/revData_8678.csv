Making sure you have an (at least) decently balanced team is cruical to suceeding and you can't just run pell-mell blasting at everything and everyone.The interface for cover and the crouch, prone toggles are a little iffy (although that's probably just me), and everyone seems to like to play Recon (probably because of the smg/sniper rifle primary choice), but this game still is really good.On a side note.... how the hell can you put suppressors on pump-action shotguns...?"

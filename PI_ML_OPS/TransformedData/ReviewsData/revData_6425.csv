,Posted March 5.,,383870,No ratings yet,True,I have played through the game of firewatch and it is definately a game that is worth playing it is a awesome story you never want to stop until its finished and it is beautiful to play and it does deserve some of what people are saying like how the ending is bad and rushed but i think that as a whole it is an expirience that everyone needs to play

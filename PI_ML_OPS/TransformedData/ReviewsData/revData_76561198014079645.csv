,"Posted March 30, 2015.",,218620,No ratings yet,True,"Great fun if you have a crew to roll with, the public games aren't worth the effort if you want to have a high degree of success or play competitively against the onslaughts of A.I on the harder modes, other wise a worthwhile buy if you'd just like something to pass the time and don't care too much what happens, it's just a game after all bro, loaded with Pay to win DLC."

,"Posted March 30, 2015.",,203140,No ratings yet,True,"A good game that unfortunately over complicates the Hitman series with Hollywood like storylines and empty, meaningless characters, took  a lot out of what made hitman, hitman. A good play if you ignore the cheesy crap that is injected into it to appease the masses."

,"Posted March 30, 2015.",,219640,No ratings yet,True,"Highly recommended, unlike any other game out there, expect maybe mount and blade but this game is fast paced, addictive and has a flavour and humour that is all its own, not for the novice or impatient.Highly competitve but also relaxed, changes server to server."

It won't help and will make you feel even worse. But this is a good game if you can handle it.It only goes for about a hour, but it deals with many themes like depression sucide self loathing and lonelyness.Should you get this game? If your not depressed I would highly recommend it. But this game is not for everyone. Though I still think everyone should expience it."

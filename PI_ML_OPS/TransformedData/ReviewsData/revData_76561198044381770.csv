,"Posted August 30, 2014.",,13570,No ratings yet,True,"Probably the best stealth game out ther, along with Hitman: Absolution. Game looks incredible, and runs at 100 fps on a laptop, however resolution only goes up to 1280 x 766. Spies vs Mercs is the best game mode EVER! Get this game, and get it now."

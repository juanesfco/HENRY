While hard to describe game mechanics by words (economics, strategies, movement), the game does not need to be descibed by words. What it does need is for you to add this game to your libary and play this game forever. A solution to those that don't like TF2, CSGO has unique functionallity that makes it stand out (combat, movement, startegies). It's the perfect blend of Skill, Knowledge and fun quick action. Just give this game a shot, trust me, you won't regret it."

Its a free to play game, which is top notch cause who dosnt like epic games that are free? This game will make you addicted to comming on steam and playing a match with your friends. This game is in my top 5 list, congrats TF2."

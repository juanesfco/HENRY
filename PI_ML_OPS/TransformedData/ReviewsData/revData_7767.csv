My view about the world widened and the hapiness I had inside felt like it was worth something.Never did such a game give me such happiness and excitement to fight with random encounters (or are they? Haha)This game is surely a 11/10 for me. Cheers to the developers!"

Really good gameplay, really good (and straightforward) puzzles - but even more, really good experience.The story of INSIDE has depth (pun intended) and is intermingled with the gameplay in a very streamlined fashion.Has really good replay value, especially, as with LIMBO, we are left with open ended endings (or do we?).Overally, I think INSIDE is a really good game. You guys must all play it.Simple game, many thoughts."

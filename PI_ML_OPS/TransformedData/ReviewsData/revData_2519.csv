I don't really know what everyone is complaining about. It is a great game, it may be buggy, but that is because it just released. I have not experienced any game breaking bugs, I find most bugs funny anyway. The episodical release will keep players interested in the game as long as new maps/locations keep on coming. If everything was released at once, they game would eventually die out, but because everything is coming episodically, players have something to look forward to and continue to play the game. I have put over 15 hours into one level which is what I was hoping for.Thank you for developing a great game IOI and thank you for publishing a great game SE!"

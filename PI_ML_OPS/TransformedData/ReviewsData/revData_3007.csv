Payday the heist is a rich game full of combat and teamwork, play alone or play with your friends its always fun. plus if you have left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 your can drop by Mercy Hospital for a fast paced chaotic one of a kind robbery. Its Fun For The Whole Family!P.S(Last part not true)"

Its a game that has really left a impact on me as a gamer and is so good its still being talked about now. Half-life is a master piece in story telling and non-linear gameplay, and with its HD remake 'Black Mesa' out now for free there's never been a better time to slip into your H.E.V suit for a Sci-fi, puzzle solving, alien and zombie killing EXTRAVAGANZA!!"

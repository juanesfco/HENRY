This so far is a trailer for the next CS:GO Major but they will slowly be releasing some behind the scenes interviews with Pros and their familys about how they got where they are and such(these videos get added to your steam library as they are released). So far the trailer proves to be nice, besides the weird sounds (AWP sound like scout, etc). Worth a watch when the actual interviews are released."

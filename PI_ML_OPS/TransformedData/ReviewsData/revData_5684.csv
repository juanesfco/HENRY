The soundtrack is to die for and the skateboarding itself handles perfectly. To me, if any game can make me want to continue playing even though I keep failing than that game is doing something right. OlliOlli does everything right. I would recommend using a controller though and putting on your game face, as I think commentating and using a keyboard may have helped me fail. May :P"

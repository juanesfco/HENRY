Gmod is a very good sandbox for creative minds, you can create A LOT of things, and I mean A LOT. Then there's the multiplayer, heaps of hours to have fun online with TTT and many other gamemodes10/10"

Though its a little different, I thoroughly reccommend getting it. The story is great and it makes you feel connected to Booker and Elizabeth emotionally. Shooting people and slaughtering the vox populi are just a small part of what is contained in this wonderful game. Other parts being the awesome story, confusing parallel worlds (you'll understand at the end) and heaps more. Irrational games has done a great job on bioshock Infinite, keeping it linked to the original series as much as possible. Ken Levine has managed to capture the feel of Bioshock in many ways. I love the graphics and how simple and great they are. The story didnt seem that important at first, but later on it gets important and amazing. Put it this way, the end made me cry.Bioshock Infinite is a great FPS, and I reccommend getting it now! :)"

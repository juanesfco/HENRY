Bewarned though the entire apeal of this game is the grind. If you are not a fan of the grind and the consistant gameplay loop than this is not the game for you. If however you are a diablo fan like myself and want to find a new experience to give that sense of satisfaction when you get a good peice of gear than warframe is most certainly the game for you."

,"Posted April 13, 2014.",,200260,No ratings yet,True,one of the best games i have ever played. It matches the openness of skyrim with the action of darksiders along with some interesting dlc.  I have to say it is one of the very few games that lives up to it's trailer.

You have the ability to play as 3 different characters throughout the game allowing people with different favorite classes to play as their favorite class.This game is a must get! Even though it $74, its damn worth it."

,"Posted March 11, 2014.",,222900,No ratings yet,True,"I normally think MOBA games are horrible. But this, this is something different. YOU GET TO USE WASD INSTEAD OF A MOUSE. AND YOU GET TO KILL ZOMBIES. AND YOU ALSO GET TO KILL BIGGER ZOMBIES. You also get to craft new weapons from materials you earn from playing the game. Did I mention you get to kill stuff?This game is really cool. I highly reccomend you to try to get a Beta Key so you can try it out before it comes out offically!8/10(Will change review once it is fully released)."

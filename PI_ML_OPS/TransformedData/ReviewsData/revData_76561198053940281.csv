With quick action from TF2 but as you get more health and the weapons are not as powerful, you require more stratigic moves as in Dota 2 or even LoL. A great combination! I recomended this game to many of my friends and we play it all the time. Great game,10/10"
,"Posted February 28, 2015.",,346010,No ratings yet,True,"I would never usually buy a game in Early Access after the complete failure (in my opinion) of DayZ standanlone (which still doesn't have choppers), but after looking at gameplay of this I thought I would give it a try. Besiege has a fantastic engine which feels so smooth running at 60fps. I have yet to find any game changing bugs and the only thing 'Early Access' about it is the lack of content, the way it should be. I would highly recoment this game to people to try out, and at this cheap price there is no point in pirating it."

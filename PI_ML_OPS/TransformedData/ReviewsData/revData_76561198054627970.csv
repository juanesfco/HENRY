,"Posted October 6, 2014.",,17460,No ratings yet,True,Ok mass effect well its hard to say what I like about this game but what I can say about the intire expirence in a whole I love this game i am on my third play through right now and again this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I persononally say this game is worth every penny but I suggest you wait until ME 1 and 2 are on sale becausae once you finish this one you will want to play the second and third. The reason I havent gone into detail is because you need to buy this game for yourself and play it. I am The Radish and this is my favorite game on steam.

I would give this a 7/10."

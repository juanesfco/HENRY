Completely single player with only the uploading of planet names as the 'multiplayer' element. Complete lies from what the author stated in several interviews.The game looks good but has no content. I lost interest in 28hrs.As for discovering new planets etc. It's the same mechanics just with different textures/colors. Basically you just repeat the same thing over and over, even the voice in your head telling you that you need to get your $60 value from this won't be enough to make you keep going round and round.I price this game at $19 or less with the expectation that more would be added."

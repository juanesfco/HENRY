,"Posted May 2, 2015.",,48000,No ratings yet,True,"Really Nice Gameplay. Slow, yet smooth movement (not my preference), but it does help to think through the puzzle whilst moving. The ending is a little ... well i wont spoil it but its something. The game is short around 3-4 hours long (thats the time i took in my first sitting )I rate it at 7.5/10"

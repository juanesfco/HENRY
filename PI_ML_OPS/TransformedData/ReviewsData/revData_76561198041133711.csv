It looks like a Minecraft only with zombies, whatever. But in truth I think that there's a lot of potential as to what they will shape this game to be.I'm looking forwards to the future of this game..."

Won a few scraps. Earned enough money to bid money for a well created Cerberus Jacket. Got a Robo-Cop kill theme. Watched a few people role-play. Had fun in general.But now, now it's all gone down in a spiral. I used loved to play this game, the customisation, the role-playing from time to time. In truth, I really, really, really dislike (absolutely hate) this game. But the reason why I play it? I play it in hopes that it will be back the way it used to be."

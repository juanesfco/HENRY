A man kills an army of weapon wielding scumbags and doesn't take it too well at start but after each countless murder he is hardened. Soon murder takes its toll on our 'hero' and the deceased begin to talk to him and his only friend is gone.Hotline Miami is a tale of one man's spiral to insanity and how he reached that destination."

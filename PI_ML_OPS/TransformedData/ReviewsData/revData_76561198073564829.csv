The in depth controls, gameplay and physics that are already in this game are fenominal and show exactly why not everybody can be an astronaut when they grow up. Don't be fooled though, if you have no clue what your doing and jump right in without reading and repeating the tutorials many times over, you will probably fail on the launch pad.Not much else to say, great game, fantastic for a pre-alpha.Learn, play, don't crash and burn.Two thumbs up!"

I can kinda get why a city simulator with wait times would be popular on a mobile device but why on pc. This isnt like a portable iphone its a pc so therefor this genre doesnt work on this platform. And if u havnt guessed already this is pay to win as ♥♥♥♥. I can understand paid items in csgo or league but in a game like this it isnt just cosmetic change that doesnt impact skill its straight up cheating.who wants to wait 5 hours for u to build up a new building in a city all to have it destroyed or downgraded by a kid using his mums credit card like a sword. Additionally half of the accounts on this game are inactive so trying to build up a group or a 'clan' is difficult because most of the people you invite wont respond. All in all dont buy this game its a waste of time.

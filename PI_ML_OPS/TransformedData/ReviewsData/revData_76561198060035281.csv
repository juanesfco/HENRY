I'm addicted to Saints Row, I have played the game over and over. Warning, This game is Highly Addictive. I really do hope they make another Saints row game, This game is defently worth the $$"
,"Posted June 29, 2014.",,209000,No ratings yet,True,"9/10 Love The Arkham Series. It's just got so many twists and turns and A interesting story line. It brings all the favourite bad guys and puts them all in a game. I see it more as a movie than a game but it is very enjoyable. The Third Person view suits the game well, I can't wait for the next game to come out. I'm a big harley Quinn fan :P"

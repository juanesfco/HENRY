,"Posted November 7, 2012.",,440,No ratings yet,True,"Typically I don't like online multiplayer games, especially online FPS because they're all about winning and who can get the most kills - not that exciting. TF2 is different though -I absolutely love the characters, different classes, weapons, game mods, maps, hats and miscs, and the community. I'd recommend trying it, really addictive."

If you really want to play this game then sure play all you want but in the later stages i suggest playing no more than 1/2 hours a day cause its gonna start ruining your brain due to losses and rigged gameplay. It has good graphics, okay-ish physics(PL is the cause of stupid deaths) and great gameplay but that's already been said for like 2 years by now. GOOD GAME JUST TRY IT, SMALLER FILE THAN GTA V.Edit: Basically the grind for new stuff takes forever because they keep adding new vehicles inbetween your current and what u r grinding."

,"Posted December 4, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,True,"Its a great game, a mixture of rust and minecraft. Though there are some additions I would like e.g set spawns or select where you want to spawn(very helpful on multi player and new maps & gamemodes (yes i do understand ths is still in its early stages)"

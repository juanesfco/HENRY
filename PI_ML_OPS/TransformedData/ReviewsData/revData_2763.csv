I've played better alpha games than this. To say this game is ♥♥♥♥ is being kind. Connected after several crashes on startup for no apparent reason. It drops connectivity and has some of the worst clipping I have seen just trying to get out of the spawn. If anything the dev's should be paying people superflous amounts of money to play this game."

There isn't much else to say except if you like the show than you need this game.As an aside to all those unsure because it seems too expensive because it might be a bit short, don't be ignorant support an awesome game that actually deserves your money! It takes about 10-15 hours, but thats 10-15 hours of top quality."

Love the car, raced it in many other racing games and simulators and can now race it in PCars. Its taking some time to get used too (Dont spend all my time on racing games] however from the 17 lap race I had in Multiplayer its a pretty nice car to use and definately is one of the good looking [and sounding] cars on the field IMO"

,Posted June 7.,,366843,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Is worth it if you are a zombies. However if you are a multiplayer only person dont bother. The MP maps die in the first week.And if you are to get it for the mp maps I would recommend getting it before the last DLC drops that way you will be able to experience the maps online like once.

But the game just doesnt keep me interested enough. For me personally its to slow. Thats my opinion and yes I know, Its based on WW2 and back then you didnt have DSR-50's and rush in and quickscope the whole enemy team with one shot :P The game was great it just didnt excite me enough to keep playing. Keep in mind if you love sitting back and watching / sniping enemys this WOULD be the game for you! :)"
,"Posted April 30, 2014.",,10090,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Amazing game. Going to admit that I bought this game souly for custom zombies but the experience is just amazing. Some of the maps you find for WaW are just amazing. Not to only mension that WaW Pc DLC is 100% Free! So you get all the zombies packs AND extra (Mods) for no extra cost. This game is comletely worth it if your a CoD Zombie fan and want to have a all new experience
,"Posted April 30, 2014.",,224580,0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,The DayZ mod is great! However DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT ON STEAM! It will not work straight up. I would recomend get Arma II and Operation Arrowhead then go search up a program called DayZ Commander. This has all the famous DayZ mods including epoch. If you want a good DayZ experience just Search it up. Hope this helped
,Posted February 25.,Last edited May 13.,311210,No ratings yet,True,"Game Definately had a rough start for a lot of people (poor optimisation, low frames, etc). However Being over couple months after release the game is definately a lot more stable and is really enjoyable. Some guns and specialists are more powerful than other guns and Specialists which can ruin the experience but overall its so fun. The zombies is really good aswell if you learn how to play the map properly.EDIT: Game now has an offline mode for zombies which is good and they have finally made an easy way to obtain weapons rather than just the microtransactions / long grind of cryptokeys. (They added contracts, if you complete a contract you get a Weapon bribe. 100% chance of a weapon)"

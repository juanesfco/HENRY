But after I got just source for GMOD purposes, I looked into CS:GO because I was more interested in the CS series after looking into it. Now thanks to some friends, I am hooked on the genuinely fun gameplay that brings a lot for what looks somewhat like a simple shooter at first. And for this low of a base price, I'd say its quite a steal. Buy this game!"

Its weird its almost like its countless glitches and horrible community make those positive experiences so much more memorible. Though features are needed, glitches need fixing because despite what i said prior there are countless games just waiting to take dayzs place so its a long road ahead and i really hope dayz doesnt get overshadowed by upcoming games like H1Z1 because deep down this is an amazing game"

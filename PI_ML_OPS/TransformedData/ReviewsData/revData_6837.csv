The fact that this game is quite unpredictable sometimes anything can happen good things or bad things. so far this game has really showed it's potential to a lot of gamers. this game is great fun i highly recommend getting this game."

The hitboxes are a a massive lie! go get CS:GO instead heaps better game.browsing the steam store looking for a good game.i stumbled across a game call WARMODE i take a look at it, downloaded it because it only took 5 mins.i ask lord Gaben if this game comes in good, he only said sorry this game only comes in: can't launch game without crashing, 300 ping on every server (mainly because i live in Australia), can't access the main menu, can't access the options or faulty hitboxes.so basically the game comes in bad or really bad right?yeah pretty much, go play CS:GO instead of this filth!"

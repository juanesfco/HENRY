,"Posted August 10, 2015.",,227940,No ratings yet,True,"Like War? Like FPS's? Like divebombing players with planes? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. Heroes and Generals is one of the better War FPS games out there. Sure i havent played much of it, but what I have played I enjoyed every second of it. At the moment the game is a bit glitchy but that is to be expected. I suggest giving the game a go (with friends makes the experience even better).And remember keep your memes fresh."

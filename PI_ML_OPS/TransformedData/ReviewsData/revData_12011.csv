This game is history, period."

It will stress your mind, will make you think hard, will mentally challenge you in every aspect. This game is utterly BRILLIANT! Thank you Valve, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!! I wish there were more sequels to this wonderful game.Rating: 10/10Reasons: Gameplay, challenges, dialogues, soundtracks and more."

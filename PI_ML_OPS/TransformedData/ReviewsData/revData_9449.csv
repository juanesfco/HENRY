Gearbox say its 'our choice' in how we play the game...but then they nurf drop rates and guns we enjoy using. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! the season pass is a rip off as well. Stick with Borderlands 2 . DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I fell sorry for whever pre-orderd this game because you only got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlc worth $5

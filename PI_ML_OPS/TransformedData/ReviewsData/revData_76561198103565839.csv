The Line is a very well-written game. Fundametally, the gameplay is run-of-the-mill. It does not have distinctive mechanics; its just your usual take-cover TPS game. For me, the gunplay became pretty monotonous after many levels. Also, the characters have clich√© identities. Heres your generic heroic guys, the special companions, and the guy-you-served-with character. Though, the graphics are also one of its redeeming qualities, its beautiful, the environments are very well-made. And finally, the story. Holy s**t, The Line's story is one of the best stories I've ever come across in gaming. I wouldn't try to spoil anything story-related; so I will just drop this:THE STORY WILL MESS YOU UP"

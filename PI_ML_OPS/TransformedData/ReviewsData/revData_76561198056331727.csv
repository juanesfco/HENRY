This is a murder mystery and you’re playing a police officer who is trying to solve the case. You do this by interviewing people, searching for clues, and finding contradictory statements. This game is almost like an extended demo or showpiece for the studio and it is truly unique. You’ll be laughing your ♥♥♥ off at the deliberate overacting and it’s truly a wonderful few hours you’ll get from this game."

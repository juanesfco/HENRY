Its great, heaaaps of fun.GOOD:-Plenty of experimentations for you to try,-Putting a picture of your choice on everything is sick (i chose seth rogan)-Quite detailed impact system.Bad:because the game is early access it has limitations that will hopefully be fixed. -on highway levels the AI cars are quite buggy/glitchy.-Some restrictions, such as path choice or obstacle placement.All in al its a fun game, worth the $7 (6.99) but i would like to see some blood textures and a bail function.9/10"

,"Posted January 13, 2014.",,42160,No ratings yet,False,"Not good. I went into this game thinking it to be good, well, i was VERY wrong. The combat is horrible and theres no servers with good connection. There were some good ideas in this game, like the visor toggle and the emblem customiser, but they're 2 little goods in a game with so many bads.Wasted my time and money on this one.1/10"
,"Posted January 13, 2014.",,211820,No ratings yet,True,"I bought this game to play with friends, then not being able to (because we couldnt make a sever) i continued to playing single player. after a few hours, i was hooked. Its great.GOOD:-Fun for single and multiplayer-Easy to get used to-Quite the challenge at times.Knowing that theres so much more to come (such as ship creativity, more races, more bosses, more crafting) i cant really write a bad part of the review, anything i would of said will be in the game soon(hopefully) anyway.DEFINATELY a game worth the price.10/10 for an early access."

If you play skyrim for simulation, then you should get this.Make a house, get hitched, adopt some kids and make them do chores, what better than that?Probably a 8/10DLC-DAWNGUARDAwesome. the dawnguard dlc is incredible, it adds planty of content and a great story line which can go one of 2 ways, Be a VampireKill all Vampires.both sides are awesome fun. DLC 10/10"

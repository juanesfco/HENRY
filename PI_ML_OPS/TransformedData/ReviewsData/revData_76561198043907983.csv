Go ahead wanna go in kill EVERYONE And and a standoff between every cop in the city? Go ahead. Payday is a amaxing game but there are some down sides to it like the AI in single player is BAD Like really BAD But don't let that stand in your way. Get it now or if you are to young and need your parents to get go on a strike something like NO FOOD Or something like that. Get in get IT And play it all your life. (This does not matter but what the hell) 8/10

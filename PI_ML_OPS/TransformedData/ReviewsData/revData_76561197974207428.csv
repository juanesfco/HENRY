Really can'rt wait to see how it goes!The only issue I have with it is the controls, too many different modes to switch through while trying to do something, becomes confusing.The way freelancer had it setup was perfect, don't try to re-invent the wheel. :)"

No, just don't expect to be doing any actual work on cars, it's all 'remove and replace'.My advice would be to wait for a discount before buying it."

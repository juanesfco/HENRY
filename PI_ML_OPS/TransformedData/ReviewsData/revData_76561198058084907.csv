Accidentaly made the mistake of calling a 9 year old 12 and got my ear drums pierced. Other than that it offers hours of some fun gameplay and moments of stupid fun. if you play DarkRP make sure to read the rules other wise people will whine and call an admin

Turns out he had no friends so we had to kill him. I also got hit by zombies through a wall. 10/10 would wear green clothes as camo
,"Posted June 1, 2015.",,440,No ratings yet,True,Joined when keys were worth 2.33 - 2.55 ref. 4 years later there worth 19 - 20 ref. 10/10 would be better off buying the keys for $2.49.
,"Posted June 1, 2015.",,227940,No ratings yet,False,My reveiw for 'Heros & Generals on Ice' The movement in-game feels like the character is on ice. Even though the game was patched to change it it still feels like my character slides and floats after i jump. Feels too much like a pay to win. 10/10 would slide
,"Posted June 1, 2015.",,265630,No ratings yet,True,Get asked to pass the whiskey too often. This game is full of alcoholics in that are trying to get me to become one of them.  Besides the some how functioning alcoholics asking for me to contribute to their habit the game offers some good western style gameplay.

,Posted March 3.,,224540,No ratings yet,True,"Ehh. Not as good as the original personally. If they had kept that you would be amazed at the stuff that happened. No Spawn Camp. Modding. hoooo That was the good Stuff. Anyways Onto What I legit think of the game.Pro's> Better Bigger Maps> Classes> Zombies> Trading CardsCons> Poorly Optimized> No Modding D:> No Classic Stuff> Simply No Amazing Classic Feel to it.Personally if you had played the classic you would agree with me.This is coolbut if you looked back at the classic, It was awesome.I even sometimes thought it was more retro world war 2 :DBut AnywaysI'd give it a 8/10Pretty Good But Needs Some Classic Aspect put back in :D"

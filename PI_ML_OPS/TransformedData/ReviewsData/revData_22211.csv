It Is Fun Trying To Complete Deliveries Or Just Drive Around With The Video Quality Settings On Ultra And Enjoy The View. This Game Sounds And Even Looks Quite Boring, But Once You Start Playing It, It Is Very Hard To Stop And Is Tonns Of Fun. If You Are Questioning Buying This Game, Just Do It. I Can Almost Garentee You Will Not Regret It."

But if you are new to the game don't even bother playing, You are just going to get wrecked by older players it's impossible to do anything without getting yelled at by other players. This game is not worth the time I put into it."

This is your game!Only bad thing I have to say about this game is it's hard to pick up, Building my Ship, Creating my Character and Trying to fight other Pirates was pretty confusing to me at first, But once you get it all down, It's one hell of an Adventure!"

This game was very worth the buy and I can't wait to see what else this game brings!The Open World Parkour Sandbox do whatever you please is just so much fun and so much fits into my taste of games.Looking for a good Sandbox? Pick up Overgrowth, You will not be Disappointed!"

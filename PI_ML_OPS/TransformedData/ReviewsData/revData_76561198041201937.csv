,Posted January 21.,,305960,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,Let me start off by saying this game holds a ♥♥♥♥ load of potential. I've been a part of it for a couple years now and the lack of improvement is just sad. The game has so many bugs and errors atm that I can barely play it.Very dissapointed at the devolopers.

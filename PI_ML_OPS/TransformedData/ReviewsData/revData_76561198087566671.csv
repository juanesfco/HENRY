D: I did however enjoy it when it was still going through the patchs, and before. It was dissapionting. But now with the emperor edition, IT IS good and I do reckonmend it; with mods and the dlc's are all good and lots of fun, and also give you the best experience. Try it out yourself. It is a great game, in one of my Favourite series; I do love this game. Thanks for reading :) Enjoy!"

And the fact thats its FREE!!! :DSo deffently give it a go. I mean i'm loving it, but I guess you already know that just by looking at my hours! :PAnyway, so its a multiplayer game and its set in World War 2. So you have three avalible factions, which are The United Sates, Germany (duh), and the Soviet Union (Russia) you should know that the Soveits were the Russians :P. Duh!Haha! Anyway, so you can go to and fro with each of your charactrs. So i'm going to stop saying so much and let YOU experience it for yourself; so have a go! (Get a whole bunch of your friends, make a squad, and i'm sure you'll have a ball! :)"

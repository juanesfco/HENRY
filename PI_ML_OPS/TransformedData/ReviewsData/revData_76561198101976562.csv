,"Posted February 1, 2014.",,208090,No ratings yet,True,"Great game, graphics remind me of borderlands. Reading most of the negative comments before i got this game, most people haven't recommended this game for 1 reason...the 'matchmaking'. I don't see the problem i have no trouble finding a match. In case you 'negative people', who are against this game, haven't notice have you tried moving closer to your modem or internet source when matchmaking. I only have 3 bars on internet and i've had no proble in the matchmaking session. Guys this is a really good game, you won't be disappointed."

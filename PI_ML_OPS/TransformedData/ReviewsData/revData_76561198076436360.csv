This game is as shown $9.99 & if you buy this game & not like it well it is not the end of the world as it is a reasonably good buget priced game.There are though the odd couple of bugs & glitches that may force you to restart the game, but they are quite rare & you will often play the game without experiencing any stuff ups."

Really realistic with Balistics for bullets, 1st person Tank gameplay, but sadly there was no Anti-Tanks cannons (Pak 34 for Germans) like on Red Orchestra Ostfront 41-45.A must have for any historian, ballistics student or just to 'every man and his dog'"

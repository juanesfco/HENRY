I do have fun with it though. But its not worth its full price id wait for a sail honestly, See what i did there?Sail?...I bought this game for one dollar and think that is the appropriate price, also if you're buying this game you should make another friend buy it aswell as it is dull playing by yourself. in the end, Extremely fun and a classic, simple masterpiece of a game"

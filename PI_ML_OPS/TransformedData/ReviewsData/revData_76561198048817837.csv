,"Posted October 26, 2015.",,440,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"The thing about Team Fortress 2 is that it doesn't feel repetitive after playing for hours and hours. There are 9 different classes for you to switch freely, on top of that you got different loadouts which in turn gives a different playstyle. (Demoknights, for example)Apart from that, this game is undoubtedly NOT a pay to win game. (Albeit there is some who hates f2p with a passion). The only thing you get for spending $ on Team Fortress 2 is that you will have extra backpack slots and the ability to trade."

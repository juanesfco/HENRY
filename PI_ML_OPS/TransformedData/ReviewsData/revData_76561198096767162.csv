A great way to play poker with hilarious dialouges from characters in the game. I honestly bought this game for the tf2 collectables and i'm sure, so did many others but i've had so much fun in this game with the poker gamemode and hilarious dialouges between moves, i've even learned how to play poker properly from this game. I'd recommend this game to all!"

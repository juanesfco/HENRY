,Posted August 15.,,391540,No ratings yet,True,This game is brilliant one of my favorite it is so fun even if you don't kill and there are beautiful places in this game and don't judge a game by it's graphics because even at full price this game would be worth it (I got it for $6.99 because it was on sale)

Plenty of things to do in this game. Launched the biggest black hole known to man past our solar system.. Earth and Mars orbited each other while flying into darkness forever.Also launched the largest star known to man ( UY Scuti / VY Canis Majoris ) past our solar system and mate.. everything burnt instantly and flew straight into it. Greatest universal game ever."

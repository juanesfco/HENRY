I did like the Telltale formula when it still had gameplay in it but now its just a camera on a rail. The graphics also leave a lot to be desired, all they did different;y from their other games was remove the black border around everything which makes the game look very washed out and dull.Where the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us held my interest through the ability to find out more about the world through exploration, this game does not offer that.  I started episode 5 and I was doing other things while playing due to the unbearable slowness of everything. Even as a 'casual' Game of Thrones fan who loves the world and the characters that Geroge R.R Martin created, the lack of gameplay is a huge hinderance to me enjoying this game and ultimately finishing it."

Everything in the game from the art style, collectibles and even the junk you gather through exploration breathes South Park and thats a good thing. Im a fan of the show and if you are too then its a must have.There are a couple minor bugs i came across throughout my first playthrough but nothing drastic. I am so glad i picked this up from launch since i rarely do that with games, just for the experience of playing a South Park episode (which it feels like all the time) is worth it."

,"Posted March 1, 2014.",,203160,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,This is one of the best games i've played in a long time. Lara Croft has been portrayed differently than previous TR games and it shows throughout the entire 13 hour campaign. The multiplayer kind of ruins the experience so i wouldn't recommend touching that but other than that i highly recommend it.

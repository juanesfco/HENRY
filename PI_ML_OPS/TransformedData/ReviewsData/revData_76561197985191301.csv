Worth it.You may think you need to know more than that, but you don't really.There's plenty of tracks, they're well made, they're both challenging AND fun, there's plenty to achieve & find, and you will keep coming back to it time after time. Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.It's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer."

You just kind of roll through it & the end is nigh.A kiddies' version of Mark of the Ninja, except the gushing blood, & adult themes of cut-scenes preclude children from playing it.Get Mark of the Ninja instead."

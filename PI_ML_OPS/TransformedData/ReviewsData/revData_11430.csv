The mechanic is still as cool as ever and in unison with the compact level designs it still manages to remain a little difficult. More of a puzzle game than anything and one that I have already really enjoyed in the short time I've played."

Game of Thrones not expected for a few more months?Well do yourself a favour and play this game.The way Telltale forms the relationship between the game's characters and the player allows for a seriously emotional experience; one that is unmatched by any TV show or movie I've come across. Awesome story, likeable characters, relationship development that is out of this world. 10/10, will cry over again in the future."

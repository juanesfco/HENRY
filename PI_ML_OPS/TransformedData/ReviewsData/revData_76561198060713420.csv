,Posted February 3.,,200510,No ratings yet,True,This game is probably the best strategy game I have ever played it is hard u should probably know this before you play but its a good type of hard and it chalenges your brain to work out ways to keep all your soldiers alive whilst taking out all the aliens. I could use some improvements in cosomisation which can be slightly improved with a dlc for the game. the felling you get when you lose a soldier is can be guilty because it was your fault they died. over all it is a great stratagy game and I recomend it to lovers of stratagy games and all other. (dont forget its damn hard so dont get cocky.)

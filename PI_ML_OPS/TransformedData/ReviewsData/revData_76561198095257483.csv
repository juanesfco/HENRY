If you make a mistake within your character you have to pay to delete it, Items that have appeal are Slapped down on a price that a F2P cannot get.I played it twice and met advertisements around every corner, Even in the shop, needed to buy supplies to expand within the game such as Bait or Seeds for your farms, The gameplay is just something you Must experience to believe it, -Crash Sim 2014: Dragon Edition.- Oh I almost forgot, You have to be a member To name your character or Dragon, Else you Become VIKING_346IJ2418, Same with the Dragons.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                              I liked the movies, I read the books, I played the game, I left in a hurry, Never again."

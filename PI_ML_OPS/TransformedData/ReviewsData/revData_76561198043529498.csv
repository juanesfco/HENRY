At the begining it was fun then you find out that everyone is better then you is when it really lets things down. The graphics isn't that great. Mechs are to overpowered. This isn't as good as TF2 well not even close.5/10
,"Posted August 26, 2013.",,49520,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,This is one of the best sequal. I might the only peson who enjoyed the first game alot but this game shows how it should be done and what fun its really is. If you don't want to buy this because the first one was trash to you then you should think about this game to buy.10/10
,"Posted August 26, 2013.",,4000,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,This game has tones of mods and the best community out there and the most items in the workshop. This game does tend to get boring in sandbox when its just single player.7/10
,"Posted August 26, 2013.",,97100,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,This game has some great features but the way it doesn't save even with windows live and doesn't allow you to open windows live in the game it makes this game terrible the actual game is good. I haven't finish game because of the windows live.4/10

,"Posted January 17, 2014.","Last edited May 24, 2014.",209000,No ratings yet,True,Don't buy this game if you want the multiplayer.IT ALWAYS DROPS OUT!This is a pain.If you can get into a match it is good fun but extremely fustrating if you are on the lossing side.It has potential if it stops dropping out. I didn't really get hooked onto the campaign side of things.I may be saying a lot of negative but it can be a great game at some points.
,"Posted December 28, 2013.",,22000,No ratings yet,True,Fun Good Better Great! End Of Review!Wait..................This has so much puzzles all the creating using these cute characters to do all of these puzzles!A bit dark at the begining well black and white is basically colors but gets brighter!9/1099cents IS CHEAP
,"Posted August 26, 2013.",,55230,No ratings yet,True,"This maybe to some people as a copy off GTA but this much diffrent in many ways. In Saints Row the Third you can have your wildest character options, call in homies to help out in battle and some great mods. This isn't the best looking game though.I definately give the flaws it has.10/10"

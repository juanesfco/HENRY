,Posted January 30.,Last edited January 30.,8870,No ratings yet,True,"Troy Baker goes yet again on another adventure this time, but instead of escorting a teenage girl through a hellish USA ravaged by some deadly fungus stuff  or aiding himself along with a legendary soldier, he goes to a flying steampunk city that any white American supremacist would call paradise. Then on, he has to find a girl and escort her to safety while fighting against the entire city and the inhabitants that want to kill him. 10/10 will fail to write good review."

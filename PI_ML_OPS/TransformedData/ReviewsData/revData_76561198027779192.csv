Furthermore, the movment is fluid and I often find myself just admiring Aurora's hair. The combat system is brilliant and satisfying with a simple leveling system and an interesting oculi (gem) crafting system. Only one complaint and that is that I was so interested in the story I actually *spoiler* found it hard to kill Nox, I quite liked her as a good guy *end spoiler*. Overall money so well spent I'm suprised it wasn't higher priced."

It's like everything I could have a gripe with is optional, or not even a problem.Fines aren't horrible unless you deliberately try and rack them up. Parking a trailer can be a challenge, but you can skip it if you're low on time/can't be bothered. Worried about fatigue ruining the experience? Turn it off, sleep's for the weak anyway.The map is massive, the environment's lovely, and the controls are tight.On top of that, it's mod-friendly, and any traffic you back up from a prang won't scream obscenities about your mum.10/10."

,"Posted February 2, 2015.",,211420,No ratings yet,True,"Dark Souls is like a back-and-forth sadomasochistic relationship. It beats the crap out of you, then once you know the ropes, you get to beat the crap out of it. Every game seems to have that one boss who's rediculously hard to beat if you don't know their patterns exactly. In this, every boss is that one boss! (Pinwheel and Iron Golem excluded. They just suck.) Expect to get plastered a lot. This one's a toughy.Pros: Incredible challenge, nice scenery, an unbeatable feeling of victory after clearing each section.Cons: Port's not so good, PvP still dominated by gear abusers."

Witness Ghandi raining nuclear fire down on the world in the name of peace.10/10, best world domination simulator."

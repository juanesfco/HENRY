,"Posted November 5, 2011.",,1250,No ratings yet,True,Simple yet with great replayability. In my opinion does 'zombie' hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth 'zombie' splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare.

,"Posted April 21, 2011.",,43110,No ratings yet,True,Great atmosphere. The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!

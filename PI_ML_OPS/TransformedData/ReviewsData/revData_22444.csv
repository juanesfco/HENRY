I am really looking forward to the next update! The only thing i would say that is wrong is that in the patch im playing, Pressing T Will spawn a boxing glove to the mouse location allowing unlimited gloves and everytime a glove is fired it will do 2000+ damage. Although i know this will get patched, It's fun while it lasted.Definately pick this up if you are into rogue-likes."

,"Posted July 3, 2014.",,202970,No ratings yet,True,"Black Ops II is a modern shooter with realistic graphics. It was fun on the whole but waiting for a zombies match or not being able to turn up the difficulty in campaign could be a little annoying. It still gets an 8/10, mainly because i'm a TF2 sort of person."

It may get boring at times but getting that new upgrade or building that new garage is always a good feeling. I would recomend this game for somone that has a lot of spare time or just loves simulators.

This is one of those where you go wow. The detail of the trucks that come with this DLC is epic. I guess Santa wanted a truck for Christmas 11/10 from me."

But that one time you win, You feel like a Boss but you were home and there were no friends for you to boast to. Well this game is great for everyone who just needs something to fill in time."

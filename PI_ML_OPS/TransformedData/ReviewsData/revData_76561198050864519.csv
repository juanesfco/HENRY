The graphical details are amazing and I really enjoy the scenery aswell. Playing as the Monster at first was a little tricky, however once you find a routine you can win almost every time. PLaying as the Hunters, well it is quite literally relying on teamwork to bring down a monster, no mattter if the monster is level one, two or three. But having said that hunters are fun to play because of their 'individual' abilities and I really like the way they have made them all unique in some way shape or form.The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it's gameplay and styles once you have been playing alot really does get repetitive.To sum this up, combined with the gameplay, the details, the hunter and the monster uniqueness and then taken into fact about some gameplays being repetitive, I will rate it 8/10 and people, it is definately worth trying out :)"

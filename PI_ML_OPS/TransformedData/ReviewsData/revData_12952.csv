Not only is the driving disgusting, and delayed but the fact that I was half way through the game and also had collected alot of the game's collectibles and done alot of the side quests and then had all this go to ♥♥♥♥ because of the game deciding to blue screen my entire computer and then corrupt my save file. If this wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft's pointless bloatware of a launcher which claims to 'synchronize my saves and achievements with the cloud' couldn't locate my save file.The rumors were also true, this game is optimised for Nvidia cards. I've got an AMD R9 270 which can play the game on ultra, although the FPS lag was horrible. I'd be shooting, driving, or even just strolling, and the game would just lock up my entire computer for about 2-5 seconds. You'd think that with an extra year to focus on this game they'd have looked at these bloody things.According to forums and Steam's own user-reviews, other's are also having both of these problems.On a lighter note, the game's actual core, stealth, and hacking mechanics are pretty nice. But Ubisoft really needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together."

I killed him, and now can completely see this game is grind heavy. If I wanted to grind through a game, I'd go for a game with at least some open world features and maybe a tad bit of story like oh I dunno, WoW. This game is just murder porn with half a story and a grind that's completely unaddictive. This game could be more, but really it's the same crap with no variation."

You can have a select number of supernatural abilities to help you throughout the game. This game is a great game to play and I would recommend this to any type of gamer. Definetly worth the money!"

Honestly, never been terrified by a game as much as I was towards this one. They did a great job on everything in this game. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is down to get terrified."

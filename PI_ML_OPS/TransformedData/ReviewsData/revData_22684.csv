,"Posted April 15, 2014.",,200260,No ratings yet,True,"I loved Batman: Arkham Asylum so much that I was kind of afraid of Batman: Arkham City. I worried that the stars wouldn't align to produce a game as good as the original, or that the game would just recycle the original without offering us anything new or surprising. I'm happy to say I was wrong on both counts. Batman: Arkham City is not only as good as the original - it's also not the same game."

The devs are leaving the original concept of the game in the dust and are beginning to turn this game into another mindless shooter game clone. If you're looking to buy this game for the first time, expect to be let down by the survival aspect of the game, or play BR like the streamers do... Maybe the devs will see in the future, but for now don't waste your money on this game until they improve survival."

It's very dreary and puts you into the shoes of a young man that can change the fate of humanity; or what's left of it. The game impressed me quite a lot, and I really got absorbed in it. It's depressing, scary, rewarding and atmospheric. 9/10."

I would recommend this game if you're willing to try out something kind of different. Also, this isn't pvp focused like I first thought."

Can't get enough of the game modes and the fact that it was made by valve tops it off. I could go in depth about how it's great but no other game that is released in the zombie genre can top left 4 dead 2."

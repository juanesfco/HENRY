I'll have to update this review eventually prior to the updates.tl;drIs this game really worth my time?  Yes, it is (well, at least, in my opinion anyway). Aside it being free from charge, I don't really see any harm in downloading Race The Sun just to give it a shot. Definitely a different and refreshing pick from the family of Indie games."

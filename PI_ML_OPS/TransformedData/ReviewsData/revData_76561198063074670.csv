Each person has their own story as well and you learn more about them through the days you survie together. Along the way you may find soem other people willing to join your group but do yoiu have the food for that persojn and the rest of your group or will your group slowly starve to death. I once encounted a group of people and attacked them when they caught  me stealing their food when I got back the charecter i used felt depressed and I even felt bad for doing that. This game leaves the player to choose how the group will survie by finding and trading or by being bandits by stealing and kill other people to survie the war 'F**k the war'

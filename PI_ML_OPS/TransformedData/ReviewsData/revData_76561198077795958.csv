(Idk, I thought it was) and the art style is impeccable!I went in with extrememly low expectations and have come out with a mutated facial defect where I have grown multiple mouths, all simultaneously smiling upon this game.For a low price, treat yourself. Get this thingy."

The servers never have me connect and my frame rate is always really low. Not to mention I bought it for $20 and now its free. Stuff this game

,"Posted November 8, 2014.",,250900,No ratings yet,True,"Look, I know it might be hard to say for a game with soo little stuff and stupid graphics, the crappiest music, the dumbest bosses, the cheapest poop jokes, the most boring item synergys, a caracter thats fricken underpowered because they start with brimstone and a main character with the name isaac who has som dissorder that causes them to have multiple personalities, but this post is from a critic and all a lie, so you should acually buy the game."

,"Posted August 14, 2014.",,22370,No ratings yet,True,"Honestly, there is nothing else to say. The game is amazing! I had doubts about it when I had first gotten it, but from the moment I started playing, I had the most fun I have had in a long time! This would probably still be fun, even without the game of the year!"

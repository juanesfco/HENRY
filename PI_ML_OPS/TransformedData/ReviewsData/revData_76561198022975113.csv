,"Posted December 31, 2012.",,72850,No ratings yet,True,"Following up on the previous review I realize I was over-hyping the game and not looking fully at the game. While the game was very detailed and improved on graphics and game play it lacked in some of the things the made some of the older Bethesda games great like character development, interesting NPC's that felt believable and could relate to, parts of the story line were predictable and not very exciting. To sum it up it is a very decent game and very fun to play but it can get a bit repetitive at times i would give it a strong 8/10"
,"Posted December 31, 2012.",,48700,No ratings yet,True,This is by far one of the most addicive sanbox games I have ever player with an execellent combat system that feels realistic with every hit and block and is very satisfying to conquer citys and towns which adds to your faction you are working with or your very own faction that you have made. the only downside to the game is that it is slow to start out your sort of wondering what to do and this can be frustrating but overall it is a very good game and i give it a 9/10
,"Posted May 27, 2012.",,35450,No ratings yet,True,good game with action and strategy combined with realism.

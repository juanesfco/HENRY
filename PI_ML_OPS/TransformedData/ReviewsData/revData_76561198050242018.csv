This is a very great visual novel and I urge you to buy it, Ogeg-sama xDHi! This paragraph has been edited in, because now I have just finished the game. AND IT IS A LOT BETTER THAT WHAT I WROTE BEFFOOORREE!!!! THIS NOVEL IS DEFENETLY WORTH WHILE! It may make you release some tears, for me it sure released a lot, and I'm pretty resilient. I would buy this for a lot more. Infinite out of 10, would play 100 times over but that would cause a flood :P"

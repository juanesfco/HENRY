,"Posted May 15, 2015.",,440,No ratings yet,True,"The game is PERFECT.The only flaw with it would be the community....and its trading....and the squeakers....and those P2P players that call F2P players idiots for no reason at all....and those CoD players that shoot every window trying to break it..But as a free FPS, the game is absolutely good, with a very VERY minor flaws on its gameplay.But i can't really explain stuff, you just gotta play the game."

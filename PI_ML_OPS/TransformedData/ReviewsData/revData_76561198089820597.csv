The fact you have abilities and stats for each unit (Orks being more offensive, while Space marines defensive.) and being able to attack pieces at range / if they are a terminator or assault marine they can melee adjacent units. I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units. If this was the final game I admit I would be unimpressed but the fact there are plenty of other modes coming and a campaign and more. I think its worth it. But.... if you strongly hate chess then I wouldnt recommend"

Not to mention its current inactivity of servers.... I WONDER WHY? its a horrible game in general, there are so many better games out there.Also I do not know this for sure but the menu looks like its stolen off Blacklight: Retribution which I would rather go into and spend hours apon hours on if it was a choice between the two.However for the time I didnt experience those issues it was a fun game... Until I noticed that there is nothing left to do after the missions other then mindless pvp that is ruined by what was mentioned above."

However my game has come into issues (Just me so wont apply to you.) Therefore I havent been able to play it much, although the time I have played has been thoroughly enjoyable. I will warn you if you hate strategy and tatics and listening to teammates then do not get it. however if your looking for a more tatical and in-depth game then I will recommend it.Being australian does not help my liking to the game, theres only 3 servers for AUS. One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve. Overall I still will recommend it because I go by the logic if I pay $15 AUD for a movie and get 2 hours of enjoyment, if I can get an hour for every $ I spent my money was worthwhile."

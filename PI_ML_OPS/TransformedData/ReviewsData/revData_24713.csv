On one hand, there can be players who are kind and try to help you as much as possible, then on the other hand are the players who love stealing other peoples' items/materials etc, which can be very entertaining at times.Gathering materials can be quite frustrating at times, but once you achieve building a house, securing your area and establishing allies, the game gets very exciting.Raids are a great part of the game as well. I tend to partner up with friends and allies, grab as much C4 as possible, and raid every base in sight. Some bases may have few materials, but most of the time you'll find heavily fortified bases that have too many materials and weapons to count.To conclude, good game, buy now."

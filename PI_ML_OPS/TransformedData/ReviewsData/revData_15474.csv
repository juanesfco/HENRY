Still, I've gotten to about the halfway point (based on the estimated length others have given) and I'm really impressed with it so far. Maybe to someone who's accustomed to horror games, it's not the scariest experience, or the most original, but it will give anyone a few jumps and keep them in perpetual fear of what's around the next corner."

I am talking to YOU Telltale,  you could say i was nearly the happiest person alive. when i begged my mum for $25 the 'package' said that I WILL get, 'All Episodes including IF you get this season pass!' so yeah, i got it, played the five episodes. When i woke up today i saw on youtube it said 'Minecraft Story Mode Episode 6!' I was like 'What? i didnt get a notification' I was about to punch a hole in my computer when it said $15 ♥♥♥♥♥ DOLLARS. Now let's hold on for a second. When i purchased this peice of poo, it said i would get ALL EPISODES so this prooves Telltale are abselout ♥♥♥♥♥ lyers and just want money."

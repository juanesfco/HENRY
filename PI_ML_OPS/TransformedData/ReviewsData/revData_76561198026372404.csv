If this is your first FMV game, buy this."

Right of the bat, I got this game because of the level design, but thats not the only thing worth mentioning about it. The voice acting is also on point. Graphics was good for its time and cant even run full max on my 3k gaming pc (SeemsGood). So TLR: If you're asking the big question then this is the game to answer it (or partly answer it (At least for me)). "

But fallout 4 is simply outstanding, you can see they put allot of effort into the map itself, weapons, armor, ect. If you looking for a good game to play on your computer, buy fallout 4.  9/10. thx"

Throughout the entire game I was immersed in Inspector Jenks shoes, tasked with one job: finding out what actually happened.There were however, points in the game that glitched out for me and it took a bit of that immersion away. Overall, if you're new to the FMV genre then buy this, you won't regret it."
,Posted July 24.,,496920,No ratings yet,True,"I came into Moirai thinking it was going to be some crazy 'maze scary, jumpscare' game with a generic sprite following you around with screams in the background. But, what I got was something even more interesting. Just like the previous reviews have said about this game;The less you know the better..."

Now I couldn't play the game day one, because I bought a physical copy of the game, and it would only install 7.7Gb of the 35. And with my Australian internet it took me 2 and a half days to download the rest, so I can't comment on how bad it was day one. However, it still could use a bit of work but the game is still very much playable. I can run the game on most of the normal graphical settings fine (And my rig isn't even that great really). People just seem to be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not having and absolutly polished 100% game. And to me, this is close enough.The story is a fantastic ending to the Rocksteady trilogy of Arkham games, and if you are any sort of fan of the previous games, you NEED to buy this."

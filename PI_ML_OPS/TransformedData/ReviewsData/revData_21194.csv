Those ****s gave us the PSV version and not the ps4 version with updated graphics and online coop."

I will say Revolution reminded me of Generations, it's more like a filler game so you don't have to wait untill the next game to play as your favourite character. The bad thing about this game is that it removes some of the older ultimated, other than that i'm completely happy with it... though it would be nice to verse people online now and again that're in my country... I don't like these types of games with alot of lag."

There is one piece missing so i'm unable to go any further in the game, i also used the HINT button to try to find it, but it's not there. PLEASE fix this. Thanks"

So much fun getting together with friends to play it with. Workshop is full of so many items, you can make it look however you want it. I'll never get tired of this game, :)"

If you ever saw the movie LETS BE COPS ( its a movie ) then do you remember the second time he went to sell his game... and it was an amazing pitch..... WELL THIS IS THAT GAME! it is amazing.... all it needs is your support and this game could become so much more. I could be a masterpeice.... It just needs YOUR SUPPORT!."

,"Posted April 16, 2014.",,239030,No ratings yet,True,YOU PLAY A BORDER COSTUMS AGENT AND YOU HAVE TO HANDLE WITH STRANGE SANARIOS SUCH AS: YOU DEAL WITH A SENILE OLD MAN AND A MAN WITH A BOMB STRAPED TO HIS STOMACH AND EVEN A PIMP SNEEKING HIS GIRLS INTO A DIFERENT COUNTRY AND THERE IS A MAN RUNNING FROM THE POLICE TO HIDE FROM A MURDER. THAT IS HOW GOOD THE GAE IS AND ITS GREAT

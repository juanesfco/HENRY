From my experience the game is good, it is certainly not a fitting end to the Batman Arkham trilogy (origins didn't exist). I was surprise that 70% of this game is Battank simulator 2015, not pleasantry surprise but definitely surprised. The 30fps capping is not acceptable at all in 2015.to bored to type anymore so 6/10 for me, if i wasn't on a beast machine 3/10TL;DR Batman Arkham Knight has stopped working"

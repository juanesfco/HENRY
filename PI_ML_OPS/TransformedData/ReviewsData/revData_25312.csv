Seriously your framerate will be around 5 if you have a pc that is lower then 8 gb ram"

,"Posted December 22, 2014.",,244850,No ratings yet,True,"A great and really well made game. I didn't really know what to expect when first playing and just moved around for a while before exiting the game. I then again played with friends and instantly it got better. I learnt the controls and actually had fun, it's a really well made game and is really fun to play if you bother to get past the boring learning bit. I hope the developers keep up this level of standard because if they do this game will really be a gem."

Heaps of workshop items that make almost every table top game possible to play. Even played table top mini golf. Regular people who teach you how to play new games.

If you get into a battle that has not started you must wait 2:30min for it to start. The weapons are overpriced.  Its realistic but needs a lot of work. For a f2p game it is ok.

It'll only take about 2 or 3 days to finish, depending on how addicted you get to it, but this is really a super fun game where there's no jumping, only reversing gravity, with a few twists and a surprisingly decent plot along the way. The game plays like super meat boy, but I hated super meat boy, and I love this."

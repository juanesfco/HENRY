,"Posted December 29, 2015.","Last edited December 29, 2015.",303210,No ratings yet,True," Buy this game whatever the price tag as by the end you will understand why it's worth it, but prepare yourself to go on a serious journey.  Pros:    Simple, straight forward controls that anyone can use.  A story/narative that will leave you wondering who you really are.  Almost 2 solid hours of gameplay if you rush through and easily playable a second time. Cons:    Will make you cry and challenge if you really are okay.  You will be broke from now on paying for therapy to help yourself move on.  Davey (Buy, play and you'll understand).I would happily vote for this game to be game of the year. It challenged and affected me in a way I wasn't expecting it to. Don't read this unless you've played, really, don't. ~  I hope you and Coda find peace Davey. "

,"Posted December 29, 2013.",,32800,No ratings yet,True,"Very VERY overpriced, buy a very good game, Okay graphics, but not great, only about consolse quality really.If you can get it for 5$ like I did, then it is a very good buy, but if you can't not really. It's a great hack-and-slash.An even better hack-and-slash if you know the LOTR lore, which in my opinion makes it more enjoyable.From me it gets 8/10.Get it if you can get it for as cheap as I did people."

Custom maps are really fun to play with a group of buddys while even fun playing with complete randoms. You will meet lots of people on here, some of my close steam friends I met on here!"

The games gunplay and movement system and really everything about it is good, the only reason I really cant stand to play it anymore/ wouldnt recommend it atm is its pretty P2W based. The rich people that can buy lots and lots of cases get really good cards while the people that dont wanna spend money on a game in beta are stuck with silvers and or leads/defaults so play if you want its just that the game runs off of who spent more money buying cases in the end. Yes, I know that you get cases and coins after leveling up and winning but the best ive gotten from those are a good silver, there for people that buy elite cases are the problem, I could go on talking about how to fix these problems but im lazy so im good."

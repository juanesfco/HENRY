This game has so many feels, It is literally the best game I have ever played. I didnt want to stop playing once I started, And going through the game I was assaulted by a army of feels that tried to make me happy, sad, shocked, amazed and overall - CONTENT with the experience I had.(Even though I still wish for more)"

You have to notice alot to read it but damn.. Theres alot. People rage debate over what could be right or wrong about their ideas. 10/10 mysterious."

,"Posted April 22, 2014.",,238960,No ratings yet,True,"Free to play and Extremely fun, in my opinion this is the Diablo 3 everyone was waiting for, Free to play games usually mean there is some form of P2W but PoE handles it very well, there is no Pay to win at all, this game is great if your expereinced with Action RPG's or not, the graphics are not so silly and realistic like, takes a dark and gloomy feel to the player! The Skill tree is very large and you can go anywhere with any class, the progression and class development is very flexible, by the end of the game you can be a FireRanger Tank if you felt like it!This game is by far my most Favourite Action RPG, I play it over TL2 or D3 anyday, and it's free! Give it a try, it will be worth your time if you call yourself a gamer!"

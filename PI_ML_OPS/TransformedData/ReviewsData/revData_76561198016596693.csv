Although there are some issues I must express.- Lag in Windowed mode can be a pain- Screen tearing gets the best of me at times- Tutorial still optimised for touch screen devices- Not able to switch keys around that best suit meOther than that this is the best puzzle/platformer game I've played to date!"

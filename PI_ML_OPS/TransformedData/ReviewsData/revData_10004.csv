,"Posted June 18, 2014.",,242760,No ratings yet,False,Ok So i dont have the greatest computer but when i get attacked i died instantlyWhen i saved i didnt have my log cabin or traps even fires.I tried to light my fires to cook food but AO ! doesnt work and when underground i can see through walls and on the first day i got attacked by day ten monsters. FINALLY I GET A GOOD START! But 10 mins later NOCLIPPING PEOPLE!?!?!?!? They walked through my traps and when i sat in my log cabin they noclipped through that I get a solid 30 fps on arma 3 with full graphics and most the same but i put this on low and i get 3-7 fps i mean come on! This game needs improvement i do still play it and it can be enjoyable but until i see things change i will not like this.

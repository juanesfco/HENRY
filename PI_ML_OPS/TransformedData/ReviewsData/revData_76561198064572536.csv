,"Posted April 23, 2014.",,550,No ratings yet,True,"Great, great game. Nothing like watching a zombies head fly off, unless you live in Australia like me, where the game is f*cking censored to the point of no control. No limb detachment, no blood splashes on the screen, no blood pools and no common zombies can die 'on fire'.Still, 10/10. Buy it, it's a classic."

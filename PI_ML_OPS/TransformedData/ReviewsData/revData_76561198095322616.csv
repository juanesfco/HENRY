This sandbox game allows you to make any creation or any form of art like posing ragdolls and taking a screen shots of them! This game is very creative i highly recommend this game if you want to create.

Theres some server bugs here and there, for example connection times out whenever you try to connect onto a server and some TPC errors when you try to connect onto a server. I cant even connect into a server anymore because of those. But i recommend you to play this game its a simple gun game."

,"Posted May 18, 2013.",Last edited July 26.,440,No ratings yet,False,"New update killed this game...Quickplay is gone, pubs are now casual servers, and matchmaking queue is taking way too much time. TF2 is a great game, but now i'm just disappointed because of this. More than 2000 hours played and now this....I'm not saying that you shouldn't play the game. It's still fun but the context of removing quickplay and making pubs into casuals is just... a downside.Exp system is also bugged... sometimes u don't get Exp for playing as hard as you can in casual.And finally, TF2 now has an official competitive matchmaking which is a disaster."

Get to play the saga's from the original (and awesome) tv series plus the new film to expand the DBZ universe, you get to customise your character from a variety of different races, statistical perks and mentors. In what other game could you become a Z-fighter which is an interesting approach to make me a little more invested in the game. Pros:+ A unique and interesting campaign+ Elaborate character customization  + Appropriatly styled graphics (suited from the tv series) + Different yet enjoyable gameplay mechanics+ Nostalgia!Cons:- Levels can vary in difficulty (their either too easy or too hard)- Online features don't function properly Inconclusion, as a huge DragonBall Z fan I personally found this game to be very enjoyable and recommend this game to fans alike. 9/10"

Pros:+ A fantastic story + Spectacular visuals and graphics + Excellent voice acting + Beautiful soundtrack+ A surprising superb endingCons:- Gets a little languid during the middle chapters of the game (but not by too much)Verdict:This game has completly set a new standard for shooter games and gaming in general, with an exceptional story combined with spectacular looking visuals makes an extreme combination for a devine experience. While it may not be perfect I would highly rcommend this game to just about everyone (it gets a little violent so sorry kids) who looks for a good qaulity story with a couple hours to kill.  Rating: 9/10    'Call of Duty eat your heart out'"

This MMOFPS is amazing I've played over 1000 hours so far and can't get enough of it. Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game and is extremely addictive, complete and loaded with action this is a great game for all gamers because it's free. Unique weponary to choose from, intriguing gamplay, customisable characters and multiple game types to play on this game will not disappoint you. 9/10WARNING: side effects of this game may include: having no life  losing money on crates losing friends and obsession for hats"

I just hope valve fixes this cause i wanna play this game again"

,"Posted May 30, 2015.",,219640,No ratings yet,True,"Pros: - Yelling simulator- You will get the hang of it if you play such games like the elder scrolls franchise- Beautiful graphics and atmosphere- Creative and funny dialogue from any character in the game (especially the classes in Deadliest Warrior)- Great music that fits so well for each setting of the game- Interesting objectives that makes you come back for more.Cons:- The game seems a bit laggy- The world seems so beautiful that some pcs or laptops can't handle it- Pings can expand extremely fast ( if your internet is crap )- Combat seems to be in the form of rock, paper, scissors ( especially being put in unwinnable situations as an archer )- Not enough cosmetics and hats :(Overall this game seems to be one of my favorite games in pc, but only if your internet is good. Just give it time to load up and when it picks up, you my friend are going to experience a game that really captures the medieval feel. And every gamers dream about fantasy battles as knights for being a hero ( or villain ) in a server.I love this game so muchI give it a 9.5/10"

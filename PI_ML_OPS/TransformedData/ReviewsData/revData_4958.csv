,Posted July 14.,,384490,2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,"Honestly all I can say is it doesn't feel like a souls game in the slightest, the ridiculous wait before you can even start to see the impact of unlocking new biomes is unbelievable, and the combat gets dry and stale within 20 minutes.On top of that, there's no key rebinding, and the developers have said they'll only make DLC if the game sells and performs well, and it'll be paid DLC. Honestly where it stands this game isn't even worth $20, let alone $30, and they still want to make the DLC paid accessI'm sorry but I just can't recommend this game in it's current stateIt's by all means not a bad game, it's just not worth $30 and I have severe concerns for it's future"

The controls do take a bit of setting up and getting used to but after a small amount of time and configuration you'll be aces. My only gripes is that the AI becomes predictable after several plays and once you have it figured out it loses much of it's difficulty. But good luck getting all Golds on Hard because you will need it.PS. When you open the game menu don't hit Start Game, go to Options and then Configuration Options for controls. So ignore every part of any review that says 'controls can't be changed.'"

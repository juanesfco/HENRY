I've played around 100 games, although not many i've been playing with a lot of heroes. The only problem i've seen is that some hero is really annoying, especially rikimaru. Rikimaru can be countered with wards/dust/gem and really squishy in early game, but in low ranked games people dont know that. They usually just stay there getting xp and then when riki blinked strike them, they run away and let riki get fat.  I really suggest nerfing riki a little bit early game just to make him really squishy. Make him not and easy hero too. Nerf his skill a  little bit so people dont always win after getting a fat riki. Overall, this game is awesome. I seriously recommend it for you people."

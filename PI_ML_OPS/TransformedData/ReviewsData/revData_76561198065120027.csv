,"Posted November 30, 2015.",,239140,No ratings yet,True,"oh wow, This game is one of the best games i have played. The story line is very interesting and the map is very big and heaps to explore in your own time when you can. Most of the time playing a mission i would get carried away from all the things that you can do in side of Harran. I have not played many hours of this game but i can tell i'll be very hooked on this game for a while which i cant wait! Thumbs up for this game, try and get your hands on this game if you have the money, im sure you wont regret it! 9/10!"

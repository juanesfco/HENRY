,"Posted March 4, 2015.",,354140,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,"Lovely game. In this game, you play as a man revisiting the retirement home to visit his grandpappy. Unfortunately, in the 1st night, his grandpappy went missing and it was discovered all the other old people bit the dust. On the 2nd night, his grandpappy was found and trie to give the protagonist a lovely old man hug. This would be fine, execpt our hero hates hugs. For the following nights, he will be hugged by all the old people's ghost and he must defend himself from grandpa by playing child noises around the building, because the old man loves children... to some extent. All this while suviving boredom with an old Atari system.Also, rule 34. 7/2But wait, no Toy Bonnie, 0/10Will tap."

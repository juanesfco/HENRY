They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their customers as evidenced by their actions, and as such don't deserve any to begin with. When (more like IF) they start respecting their fans as a whole across all platforms, as is deserved, then maybe it could be considered a better idea to buy their games. The sad part is that lots of people like me bought the premium edition, which is by no means cheap, and most people would think that doing so would allow them some sort of special rights when it comes to DLC, usually in the form of a discount or early play. That way, eventually everyone will still get to play it. Dropping it completely is not only a foolish choice as a developer, but unfair on the whole community plus those that went the extra mile to be cut short. TL;DR ♥♥♥♥ you NRS, and ♥♥♥♥ you WB. Greedy scumbags. If I could get this refunded, I would, and would recommend everyone else did too. Keep treating people like this and you're going to lose a lot more than one platform of consumers."

I love the game, even if it's my least favourite Treyarch campaign to date, but after spending so much money to get it, I can't see them needing money so badly that this has to be a thing. DLC 3 and 4 better be something spectacular."

,"Posted June 2, 2015.",,250900,No ratings yet,True,You can't 100% the game unless you can make it through each floor without getting hit once. You may find yourself trying to make real life deals with the devil to complete this one.

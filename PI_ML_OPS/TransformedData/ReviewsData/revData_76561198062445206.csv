It is very addicting and is fun to play whit all your friends! You can build huge constructions by day and battle monsters by night. I know for a fact that the developers are caring people due to their involvement with a community that I am apart of.Upsides+Very addictive gameplay.+Fun to play with friends.+A variety of different enemy and NPC types.+The game has a good sense of humor.+Dancing!Downsides-When I first ran the game I thought I was running the game on a potato not a $1,000 computer.-Requires some settings adjustment before it runs without lag.-Ran into multiple collision errors (Trees)-If you jump onto a rock next to an ocean the rock likes to throw you in. (Falling into the ocean will kill you.)-No way to change key bindings.Overall Early Access Score = 8/10"

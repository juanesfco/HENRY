The controls take a little getting used to so you can expect to be eaten a few times, but once you get the hang of it its awesome fun.  those guppies swallowed whole three at a time, so much fun omfg!"

If there is anyway to play this with keyboard and mouse i would gladly give it another go, but as is, i just cant recommend it.  Really hoping this issue might get fixed sometime soon, like i said, I'll be happy to give it another go."

This sim is possibly the most user unfriendly sim I have ever played.  The Graphics are lovely (as seen speeding skew off a runway and into the buildings!), but I can't recommend it to anyone who is new to sims (or anyone who expects to be able to adjust the sim either in menu- or in game).  I guess its back to the 128 page manual.  Bummer, I am sure It will get easier... at some point."

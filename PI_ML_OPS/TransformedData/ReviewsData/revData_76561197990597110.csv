,"Posted May 30, 2014.",,243470,No ratings yet,False,"Day 3 of the release here in Australia: Still cannot log into Uplay in order to play the game. Even if I do manage to login the constant frame-rate drop, poor driving controls (like dodge-em cars) and relatively bland side missions makes this game look worse than GTA IV and Saints Row 4.Do not buy this game until Ubisoft addresses a lot of these issues.i7 3770 3.0ghzGTX 67016GB RAMStuttering and framerate drop from 80 to 18."

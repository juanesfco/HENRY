,"Posted October 14, 2015.",,113200,No ratings yet,True,"Even after 4 years I would still highly reccomend picking up this game after the afterbirth were to be released, here's why.Pros:Story is great and has you diggingGameplay is quite enjoyable, given, you don't get bugged af enemiesCharacters are have their own gimmick to them (especially ??? KAPPA)Item's are vast and varried which can also synergise quite well (Some items will be excluded from awesome synergies to basic damage or tears up, really.)It is difficult at first but incredibly fun and easy later on once you learn the game and some movementsEnemies are fair and balanced (Except for maybe 3, which I will discuss later)Graphics are old school which I personally enjoyNow for the bad parts of this gameCons:Spiders and a particular boss (To my knowledge this boss cannot fly over pits but rocks, wtf.) are very buggy and can be at times, unfair.Game lacks synergies which have huge theoretical awesomenessStory can ♥♥♥♥ over your mind quite hardlyBut all in all I give this game 9/10"

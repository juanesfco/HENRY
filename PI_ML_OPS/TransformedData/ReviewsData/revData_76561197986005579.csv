,Posted April 16.,,237990,No ratings yet,True,"A tale beautiful in both story and art design told through a fairly bland underlying combat system but even that thin, repetitive veil never gets in the way of your immersion and thus the games plot and music and visual design draw you in like no other. The only other major quarm in how abrupt the ending of The Banner Saga is, I don't want to say anymore out of fear of spoiling the game but let it be known that the ending felt a little undercooked.RegardsBohlsi"

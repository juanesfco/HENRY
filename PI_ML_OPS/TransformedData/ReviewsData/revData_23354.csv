Endless possibilities of what you can do, different game modes, weapons, vehicles and more. Although, online play could get a little bit annoying seemingly there are very few servers located in SEA. So, there will be much lag due to high ping along with different stuff you have to download to go to the server. 7.5/10 Recommended."

I feel like it has been quite a good MMORPG game eventhough it is competing with LoL and other MMORPGs. But, be wary as it sucks you in if you're addicted and there is a lot of Russian in this game. So, yeah, 8/10 Recommended."

Best played with friends to make it a more intresting experience. Could improve on the online play. 7.5/10 Recommended playing this game."

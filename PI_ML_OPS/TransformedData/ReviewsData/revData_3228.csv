,"Posted January 21, 2014.",,570,No ratings yet,True,"Game is fun, a bit unbalanced with certain items and classes but fun none the less.There are a few issues with UI when you are running a non standard 16:9 resolution, other games such as LoL and even Smite have none of these issues.I have a 2560x1080 resolution and am forced to play in 1920x1080 as the UI takes up 1/2 the screen in 2560x1080, similar issues with 16:10 reported on forums over a year ago."

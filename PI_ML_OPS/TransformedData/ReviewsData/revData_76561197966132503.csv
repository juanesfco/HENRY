It's all about breaking down problems into smaller components that can be composed to generate a solution. Very rewarding to see a finished solution working."

This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment.  The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well."

,"Posted September 14, 2012.",,211420,No ratings yet,True,"Hands down my favorite game of all time, here is a game that knows what it's about, and doesn't care if you get it or not.  This game is hard, not arbitrarily, but in a way that challenges you to experiement and learn. The setting and story are incredibly deep, and the atmosphere is genuinely haunting and foreboding."

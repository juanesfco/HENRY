Deafinitely not for everyone, a couple of my friends bought the game tried it once and didn't enjoy the different action pace. This game will be very slow and mellow for 60% of the time then in the matter of moments you will be faced with many descisions that might lead life or death.'the real draw of DayZ is a combination of the risk of losing everything, or potentially coming out on top and winning everything' - Brian Hicks, DayZ Producer."

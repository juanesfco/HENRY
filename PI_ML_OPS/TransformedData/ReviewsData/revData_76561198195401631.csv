From changing their names and avatars, to guns and equipments, the possibility is endless (thats a lie). But, I could easily find myself spending a couple of hours into the game. So if you're still pondering over the game.... JUST GET IT ALREADY! Trust mehUnless you absolutely hate strategy games :P"

You control the relationship and how you want things to turn out. What i think it could improve on is the freedom of choice. Right now its alright, but I would love to have more choices. Anyways this game is awesome so definitedly go try it out :)"

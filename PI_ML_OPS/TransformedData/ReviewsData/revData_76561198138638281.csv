The one thing I hate about this is the optimization or lack thereof. Sometimes i get 90fps on medium settings 70% 1080p. Sometimes I get 30 fps on 1080p at LOW settings. FFS Treyarch get your ♥♥♥♥ together. ♥♥♥♥ you treyarch for making consoles looks good on this game.

Not a lot Nelson can do about this though except implement official servers, this however would obviously intrude on a FTP model. One of the best things about this game is the weekly updates being churned out by one man. Looking to buy the $5 upgrade."

,"Posted December 26, 2014.",,339120,No ratings yet,True,I love this game. The graphics aren't perfect and the game play isn't flawless but the storyline is original and even though I feel like raging when I fall in a smallest patch of spikes its still pretty damn good!

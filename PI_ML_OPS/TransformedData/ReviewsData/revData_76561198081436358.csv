Don't bother getting Payday unless you have $20 for the game and ANOTHER $50 just for DLC then can play for the cases. And finally payday 2 is just a game for people who want to grind for a thousand hours and i can think of 10 better grinding games straight away. please don't bother unless your rich.

The weapons and effects are beautiful and there is no real need for the mircotransactions, they can be completely ignored."

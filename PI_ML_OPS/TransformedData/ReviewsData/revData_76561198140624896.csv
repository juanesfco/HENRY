I really dont understand Minecraft is the 3rd most played game but Terraria is better so it should be the 1st. When I played Terraria I was like Minecraft, whats that. Terraria is the best game for the following resons:.No lag.Guns.Loads of bosses.Easy crafting.Lots of fun.Loads of items.Powerfull weapons.2D for easy mining.Not many mods (obviously if theres not many mods its a great game)Overall I rate Terraria 101/100 its so great:)"

But its still a fun game even if you do play with hackers and the acheivments are easy to get unlike othe games ive played so yeah ill rate it 10/10."

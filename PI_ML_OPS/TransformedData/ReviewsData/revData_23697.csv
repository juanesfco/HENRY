,"Posted October 29, 2015.",,263280,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Spintired is a decent game that performs well in most areas but slightly lacks in others. A few problems I see with it are that the missions and objectives do get a bit repetitive and can take a very long while to complete. Also in my opinion with the graphics turned all the way up the game still lacked in image quality. Apart from those things this is a good game and wpuld recommend this to any serious gamer.

Unfortunately this game went on a decline about a year after release and has since only got worse. The micro transaction announcement was a disappointing development but one I can't say i'm truly surprised by. This company just isn't the same as it use to be, nor is the game. I'm glad I was around since the beginning for this game and got to play the 'golden' days of its early release but it just isn't anywhere near as fun or interesting as it use to be."

If you can get it on special, even better. Fun storytelling, good combat/perk system and I enjoyed the campaign. Plenty of content after you finish the main storyline with extra difficulty settings, arcade mode and duel mode.I highly recommend this to fans of old school shooters and people who enjoyed Painkiller/Far Cry Blood Dragon. If you are someone who expects every game to revolutionize a genre or be breathtaking, this isn't the game for you as this is more about having fun and not taking the game to seriously.Hope you enjoy"

Not the greatest PC port but not the worst i've played either. You really need to be a Metal fan or at least able to listen to that type of music because the whole game is built on music of that genre. It was fun to play a different type of game instead of the usual stuff. At the discounted price you can pick this game up for, you really can't lose. Hope you enjoy it.P.S. The Lore is the best part of the game, make sure you get into the back story as much as possible."

,"Posted June 4, 2014.",,201810,4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,"Great Game.A throw back to old school shooters from the 90's. Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did."

The game is so bad that just having friends come online on Uplay will crash the entire game. This bug has been around since 2012 and still not fixed. If you live in certain regions of the world the online multiplayer is straight up unplayable with terrible host migration. It would of been better off if this game was never made, that is how had it is. Disgusting."
1 person found this review funny,Posted March 2.,,427820,8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful,False,I really enjoyed this game but the achievement system is bugged. There is input lag on movements which will sometimes lose you a level and hasn't been ported to PC well. Due to these issues I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment but if they patch them and reduce the price I would highly recommend it due to the gameplay and puzzles being very fun and enjoyable.I worthy Hitman puzzle game plagued by issues unrelated to the gameplay. A shame really.

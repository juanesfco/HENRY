,"Posted December 28, 2013.",,224760,3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful,False,"A bland and boring 'game' made by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ called Phil Fish (Look him up)It looks good, but good graphics isn't a substitute for bad gameplay.The puzzles and worlds are overly simple to solve/navigate and the only mechanic gets boring to use after an hour.Don't trust all the big review sites like IGN and don't spend money on this boring 'experience', buy a dvd on paint drying in slow motion(More interesting than FEZ will ever be) it's not worth buying this game for the full price or discounted in steam sales."

[That is sarcasm for those of you too stupid to figure it out for yourself]The pacing is perfect, it's not a true survival game unless it takes a year to do anything.The Dinosaurs look great, everyone knows dinosaurs are part rock monster. It's very uniche and not just a survival game with dinosaurs thrown in to cash in on jurassic world.I also love how when you review other dinosaur games negetivly people say 'Try Ark' it's very useful cause I had never tried it before someone told me to, not at all. Overall I give the game a 9/11 it's perfect no flaws at all, and if you think otherwise then screw you."

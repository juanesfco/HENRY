Come on penguin, hurry up so you can get back to playing!So, the best things about this game are:- Community Wiki- In Game chat (Everyone is polite with the usual 'gl hf' and 'gg'.- Graphics are just *_* AMAZING :D- Maps are easily playable and the regular game updates keep this game enjoyable.However there are a few things that could be improved:- Vote kicking can sometimes have enough votes to pass yet come back as failed- I personally feel that team switching should require 1 or 2 less votes to pass- My aim :D All in all, one of the best games that I've ever played.

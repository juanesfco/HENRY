If you don't like hard games then you might want to steer clear, but even as a very difficult game there is plenty to enjoy. The difficulty can be both punishing and forgiving, as you die in one hit, but thankfully the game only restarts you back to the start of the area. The gameplay is fast-paced and suspenseful, keeping you on your toes for the whole game as you attempt to take out all the bad guys in one area without taking a hit. The game forces you to implement some strategy and stealth into the action, making an excellently balanced blend of fun which is surprisingly addictive as you try over and over again to pass the area.The setting and story also help the game immensely. The Miami setting gives the game a great colour palette to work with, and makes the top-down world look vibrant and safe, a contrast to the actual gameplay. And the story....it's confusing, but done so well as to make you guess what is going on, and allows you to speculate on several things, like the guy who appears in every store you go to after each level, and acts oblivious to the fact. But you know there's something to him.All in all, Hotline Miami is well worth the $10 pricetag, and you should definitely get it when it's on sale, even if you aren't interested."

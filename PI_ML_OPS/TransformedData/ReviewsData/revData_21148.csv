It combines your 'usual' FPS with cartoonish, highly customisable Characters. Each of the 9 Classes are evenly balanced in such a way that no class is better or worse than another. They all have Pros and Cons that cancel each other out. Along with Weapons which have additional statistics to further add to that Class' Abilities. All in all, it's a Fast-Paced, Highly Strategic FPS that is Continuously, Thouroughly Enjoyable. 10 / 10   :D"

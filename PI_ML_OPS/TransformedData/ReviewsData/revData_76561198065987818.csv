Computer is not on fire.Coffee + Computer = Computer is on fire.What kind of game melts your pc while maintaining a constant 5 fps during large scale battles (the whole time)Planetside 2 is the kind of game.8/10 would play on Thanksgiving and Passover.

It is one of the most complex yet simple puzzle games out there today. Its completely revitalises the core mechanics of the bejewelled franchise. The genius of this game is unrivalled by other companys. I thank you EA for bringing us another classic.I give this game a 6/9 gems.

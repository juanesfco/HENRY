I have played 913.2 hrs on this account and 1560.2 hrs on my other account and I still havent got tired. Amazing game, Good fun, Fun community. Do not worry about hats and miscs they will drop in the server you playing on and you might just get one. Also collecting weapons and turning them into scrap will also be a way of you to get hats or miscs. 5 STAR GAME."

Certainly picks up from the Serious Sam Classic's in gameplay and style, unlike the Serious Sam II Failure in my opinion and we also got all the old Menu Features and Game Editor, so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to see more Mods and more Maps.Serious Sam 3 is definitely a Must Buy for all Old School Serious Sam Fans. A Big Thanks to Croteam for this beautiful game."

A Must Try, Perfect Mixing with Music and Gameplay Shooter Experience and really fun with impressive lightshow fighting scenes, sitting on the edge of the chair through battles when music tunes up! Don't Forget Fun Boss Battles with Sweat on forehead ;)"

Conversations are happening very slowly and you only have 2 options, 1 Evil and 1 Good, also walking around pleasing the Citizens by greeting hundreds of people and doing small walk quests several times gets very tiresome and takes a huge amount of time.I must admit the start of the game gives a good impression and its fun to unlock the main chests on the spirit road and see weapon upgrades, but that is quickly done and the variety of weapons are very slim, also they even almost all look alike.The game overall if you dont complete all the pointless things, wont take too long to complete and the Story Mode feels fairly short and not really that exciting either.Im very sad about it, but i have to say No to Fable 3, i simply cant recommend this, im a huge fan of Fable, but i give reviews after my own thoughts, opinion and experience through out the game and this story simply wasnt enjoyable at all and the gameplay lacked just as much, very doll and boring."

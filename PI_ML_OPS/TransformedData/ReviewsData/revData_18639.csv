Because as long as they're using the Arma 2/parts of the Arma 3 engine this game will be an absolute poor commercial release. Bohemia seems to be a positively recieved company because of the Arma series, but if you take a look at the rest of their games, they are absolute trash. The game engine too, is absolute trash and is poorly optimized. It would be 10 times better if they licensed a better more commercial engine. This game is deemed to fail without a better engine."

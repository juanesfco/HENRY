So only play CS GO if you can be bothered having the timing reactions of a computer. FPS for PC, and the non 1% of top players (which is probably everyone below Nova 3). has become a sad pool of needy people. IF you are a top 1% player, play CS GO, if you cannot make top 1%, buy a hack and then you will feel elite."

WTF turtle rock you CASH GRABS!!!! I DIDNT EVEN GET ANYTHING LIKE SKINS OR EXCLUSIVE SH** WTF I HATE YOU CASH GRABS WHO TAKE MONEY AND DONT GIVE BACK. ID RATHER PLAY DAMN LEFT 4 DEAD, THAT REPETITIVE ♥♥♥ GAME THAN THIS. that said this game is still repetitive if not more repetitive than damn l4d or l42. other than your average hunters you start off with, you need to pay to get hunters, and monsters. i spent 50 bucks i better get something out of this. THIS IS MORE OF A COMPLAINT THAN A REVIEW IM SORRY BUT STILL GIVE IT A TRY BUT STILL JUST DONT SUPPORT THE GAME BY SPENDING AT ALL....................."

PLAY THIS GAME, GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY AND CUSTOMIZATION IS ALL HERE!!!! PLAY IT!!!!!"

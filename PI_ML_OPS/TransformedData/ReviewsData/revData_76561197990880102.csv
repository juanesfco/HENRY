Not to mention ♥♥♥♥ yourself when you run into a guy wearing a Payday mask standing under a lamp-post in the middle of the night."

Especially when health is limited you take down a guy that makes you use all of your health packs only to find out after you pass him you've hit a dead end and have to immediately fight this ♥♥♥♥ again. Money well wasted on what could've been a great game, too bad it only takes one feature to ruin everything good about this."

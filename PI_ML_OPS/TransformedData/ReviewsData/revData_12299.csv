It has had yet another price bump making it even more overpriced. 75% of this game is walking around trying to find a town or something, 24% of the game is looking in the towns or whatever for items, and 1% of the game is fighting zombies, in which case if you don't have a gun and ammo (which is usually extremely hard to find), you may be able to kill it, but it will leave you bleeding and you will eventually die from blood loss. And when fighting the zombies, especially with melee, it is extremely glitchy and hard to kill them."

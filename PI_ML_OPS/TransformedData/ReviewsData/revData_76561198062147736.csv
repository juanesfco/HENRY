,"Posted March 20, 2015.",,9900,No ratings yet,True,"A good game, but it has pros and cons (like all games)ProsThe gameplay and strategy are really very good. Playing with friends is pure fun. The ships are interesting which give you the incentive to try and level up to get new starships.A very deep crafting system, but alot of the time you will find you sell swimming in money, as a lot of simple things you find or craft sell for alot. Some people will like this (including me, which is why i put it pros)ConsThe Storyline is a bit boring, you don't really listen to the dialogue since there is no voiceovers, which just leaves you like a henchman doing what everyone tells you to do not knowing what the outcome is.The missions are very repetitive, you really just go around scanning things in space, and that occasional ground mission or space fight, which, are not that bad.Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.Not a bad game at all."

And, no surprise. I loved it!- Music is amazing.- Gameplay feels smooth and controls are responsive. - The story, although not too obvious, is pretty compelling. Overall, this game is amazing. Buy it.Oh and the new update is cool too, so yeah-"

,"Posted December 5, 2013.",,225260,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,Oh. My. GOD. This game is pure awesome. The voice acting in this game is FLAWLESS. The overworld is so big and there are MANY hidden secrets that can only be found when exploring. There are TONS of sidequests if you wanna take a break with the main mission. The combat is good. And just. Wow. This game is fun. 10/10. NO. 11/10. NO WAIT. 1000000/10. :3

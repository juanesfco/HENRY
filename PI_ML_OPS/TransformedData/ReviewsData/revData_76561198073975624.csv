Yea there may be fps problems but Bo3 is a breathe for fresh air for the cod genre. The weapons are pretty balenced and the perks too. This is a game that i find you can play for hours on end, and not have that typical bad cod taste. I strongly reccomend this game. For all New COD and Seasoned players. Rate 8.5/10"

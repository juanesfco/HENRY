,"Posted June 29, 2014.",,209160,No ratings yet,True,Firstly this game overall has potential to be good but...The multiplayer is crap and usually there is no one even on the servers. They also take forever to load or even match you to a server. If they fixed the server issues it might be betterThe single player mode is great. The story is decent and you can play as a dog (Awesome)
,"Posted June 29, 2014.",,63380,No ratings yet,True,Great game especially if you got it during the 48 hours when it was freeIt is good but sometimes you get stuck but you can come back later and usually finish the levelLove the cinematic brain blowing sniper hits. It really adds something to the game

,"Posted February 25, 2014.","Last edited February 25, 2014.",104900,No ratings yet,True,If you are paying $0.99 for this game it is good. Several maps and Boss Dinos it aint too bad.But I wouldnt pay more than $5 for this game so buy it while its cheap.Still a reasonable game to play with others online. Also lots of achievements to keep you going
,"Posted January 16, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,Great game but can sometimes take a while to download extra maps and textures to play certain servers.But it is still a great game and isnt too expensive

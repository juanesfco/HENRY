I was joked at and laughed at about not being able to throw a bag. I was in a really dark place, but then I found Payday 2. Slowly, I started to copy their exact bag throwing techniques, until eventually I became a master of bag throwing. I went on to win a gold medal in bag throwing at the London Olympics. All I have to thank, is this game."

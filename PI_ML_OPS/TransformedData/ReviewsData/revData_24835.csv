Also the person I need to make and supply with a medical pack is invisible along with everyone else apart from 'The Boss' wo gave me the first mission... I almost forgot to say, when I left the tower there was alot of glitched objects and invisible floors and doors.I recommend this game but.. Please Update this!!!"

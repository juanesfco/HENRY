,Posted January 5.,,254200,3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful,True,First couple minutes of the game I had absolutely no idea what was going on. It didn't take me too long to get used to all the games mechanics. Before long I was rolling around in piles of my Ingots. With each research complete I was getting more and more excited to see what the end-game would be. Now that I have gotten to that point I have a huge challenge ahead of me and I can’t wait to see what I can do with it. I've had the game for 4 days with roughly 90 hours of gameplay. Most addicted I’ve gotten to a game in a long time. Buy it!
,Posted August 31.,,411830,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,as a big fan of the Senran Kagura series I was glad to see it had been ported to the 'Master Race'As for gameplay and such it's exactly the same as the original console version but better because I don't have to turn on my PlayStation to start playing. 10/10.

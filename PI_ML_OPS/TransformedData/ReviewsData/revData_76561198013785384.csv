The singleplayer campagn is laughably  boring and rather prodictable. Muiltiplayer is ok with friends.Little from the Supreme Commander/forged alliance survived.Amphious or underwater walking gone.(not hover)More Experimentals just less effective, clones like the soul ripper 2 and fatboy 2 are shadows of thier formersevles.Aoen have no navy.Graphics have not been imporved.AI while more challanging at first will bore hardcore/RTS veterens.Not much stratagy, whoever spurns out more units fastest wins. Less maps and smaller.Cybran commander looks deformed.Tech tree and tier system gone. Replaced with exp system which become pointless once everything has been unlocked.Economy has no running costs for Shield generators nor artillary This game feels so watered down it is just not funny. if you loved the first game stay away from this mess if you didn't like the orginal then it will bore you."

Play Skyrim anyway you want, do quests in your own time, complete freedom of movement. Craft weapons and amour, then enchant them. Use a vast array of spells, shouts, potions and racial ablitles. Become any charcter you can imagine. With hunderds of hours of gameplay you won't be seeing the light of day anytime soon."

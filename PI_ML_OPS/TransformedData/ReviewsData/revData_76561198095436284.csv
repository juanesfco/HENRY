,"Posted February 27, 2014.",Last edited June 12.,252490,No ratings yet,True,This is one of the best made early access games on the steam store at the time of writing this as it is constantly improved with each and every update. The game is incredibly enjoyable as there is so many different layers of this game. There is a great and immersive PVP style of game-play where there is many different weapons to use to defeat your enemies. There is also a great focus on hunting to gather important materials required to have a large and successful base. Another thoroughly enjoyable part of rust is the base building aspect where you can create incredibly small bases to enormous compounds to protect the loot that you steal/find from various other sources. All of these parts of rust combined result in a fantastic survival game experience. I highly recommend this game and I give it a 10/10 rating. This game is worth every cent.-Quitespace

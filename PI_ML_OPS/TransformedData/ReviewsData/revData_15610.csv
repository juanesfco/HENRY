Combined with fantasy, turn-based strategy, cute slimes, godcats, decent humour, weapons and armor and what do you get? Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is one of the best adventure fantasy games I've ever played. Explore many different areas and worlds as well as exploring the different array of weapons and armor. Defeat monsters including slimes to killer robots. And of course, Natalie still has her bewbs :3. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this. :D"

Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story."

,"Posted June 14, 2014.",,72850,No ratings yet,True,"Skyrim.... Where to start? Really, the greatest game in the Elder Scrolls series and possibly the best open world game around. Will keep you going for a VERY long time. Two things I really love are the endless combinations of items you can equip and the copious amounts of loot you can collect. I highly reccomend it."

Why has no one tried games like this before ?Attacking, defending and holding trenches - which btw is very hard unless your team works together.If you like tactical shooters that punish poor decisions this is for you. Your team is divided into4 man squads of slightly varied equipment. TEAMWORK is VITAL.Putting AAA games to shame with 4 FREE DLC 's under development.Smaller aussie community but there is always a couple of matches going with good connection.I really wish this game had a larger aussie community but have had no issues thus far.To all those who served in WW1 Lest we forget."

,"Posted July 5, 2015.",,346110,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Early Access Review - 06/07/15 ( will be updating as the game progresses )ARK is your typical survival crafting / building game - But has a character levelling RPG element to it.This game as of right now does require work - Optimazation especially. I personally have not had many issues atall - I have been running this game on medium settings and it does lag from time to time.What you do have so far is a solid foundation of a game to build upon - All the standard crafting and building elements plus there is DINOSAURSSSSSSS!@!!!!!$@!$@#!$%!@ ( maybe im too hyped from seeing jurassic world too many times already who knows )This game has massive POTENTIAL.That is all well and good - I have the potential to be a ♥♥♥♥ing genius but the odds of that actually happening ?We all will just have to see what the developers end up doing. Will they build upon a solid base ? or take everyones cashand dissappear to the ♥♥♥♥ing moon. Watch this space.From what I have played so far I genuinly have enjoyed myself - If you like crafting building survival and dinosaurs maybe give it a go - or play it safe and wait a month or so to see how its going.

,"Posted November 29, 2014.",,35450,No ratings yet,True,"This game is for those who are after a challenge and none of this arcade killstreak ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t year after year.For those who love teamwork get it, for those who love WW2 themed games buy it,has some pretty damn good immersion. First game i played i saw a guy hold a grenade too long - blowing both his arms offand killing 3 squadmates while taking cover. the gore was tops.Tatical shooter at its finest, first play session i had online was 4 hours without realising.great game 10/10"

Fairly decent job of making you believe you are actually being hunted by the alien as opposed to just randomly throwing jump scares at you. The game is genuinely enjoyable if not a little repetitive at times. Lousy save game system and checkpoints are way too far apart but atleast it has a sort of manual save option. All in all, I would say that it does justice to the first Alien film. 7/10 only because of the stupid savegame system."

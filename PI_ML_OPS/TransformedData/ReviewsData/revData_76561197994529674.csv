,"Posted November 10, 2013.",,248820,No ratings yet,True,Kickstarted this game and boy am I glad I did! It's at it's core a platformer. But with so much to unlock I can see myself playing for many more hours. There are some cool powerups to be found on each randomly generated world with even more to be unlocked by playing through. The lore is told through randomly dropped logs from enemies and the backstory unfurling is quite an interesting one. Highly recommend this one.

,"Posted October 27, 2011.",,55040,No ratings yet,True,This game is a bunch of fun! Taking the regular RTS formula and speeding it up keeps it really interesting. Very easy to mod too which makes it last a little longer. Well worth the cash!

I definately would like to see either a Co-Op campaign added or an ability to create non pro servers for non pro members. In my opinion this game deserves a 9/10."

,"Posted March 19, 2015.",,2280,No ratings yet,True,Despite the age of this game it still stands tall among other FPS titles.The atmosphere and gritty SFX still leave you guessing and on your toes.I reccomend this title for gamers young and old and of course the purists out there.I give this a solid 8/10.

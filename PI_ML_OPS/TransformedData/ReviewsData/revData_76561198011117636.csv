The learning curve is really steep, but once you're over it, it's the most fun you'll have in a Moba. Bring friends."

A lot of depth, fun combat, great world to explore, clever monster mechanics and a continually expanding endgame makes this seemingly basic concept incredibly deep and will give you hours of fun with your friends (if you can figure out how to set up a stable server). The building mechanics are also a lot of fun but pretty consistant and kind of mundane. I would definately recommend this game 8/10."

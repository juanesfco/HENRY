This by far has to be one of the greatest games I've ever played, the writing and acting are to broadway stage performance quality, it is filled with funny one-liners, true, emotional and down to earth dialogue between the characters, nothing seems stupid or forced in the writing. So all in all, I would say it is almost a perfect game, my only complaint is that I feel the asking price for it is too damn high, maybe somewhere around half the price, and this game would be perfect.9.5/10 - IGN"

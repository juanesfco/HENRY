I was just blown away in the first 5 minutes of the game. Voice acting is crisp and is very well done. Cutscene were amazing and they made you really feel for each of the chartacters. Combat, sealth and cover system felt so natural. After completing it I had remembered that it was a reboot which made me excited for the next game,"

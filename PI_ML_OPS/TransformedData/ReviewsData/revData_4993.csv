TF2 for me is like Christmas every day, it is fun, enjoyable and you get free stuff. It is one of those games that if it wasn't made life would be some much different, It would be like no Christmas, Easter or even your Birthday. So Yeah play it.                                                                      Rating 10/10"
,"Posted December 1, 2013.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,Garry's mod is possible the best game in history. i have wasted OVER 9000 hours f-ing around in sandbox mode creating contraptions of chaos and some times a scene or two. i would recommend this game to any gamer of any age because your never to old to act like a kid. i would rate it OVER 9000/100

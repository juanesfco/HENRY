Even though it's short and had bad endings which made you re-start the whole game unless you saved, I could feel the creators have poured their heart on the visual novel. Small things like these are good based on what effort the creators made. 10/10 for this visual novel. Short but had a good story. Keep going Miss Vinty!"

Soon after that train of thought you laugh and remember you don't have a life.

The best thing about this game is how fast you can go, up to insane, inhumane speeds (I don't know who anyone could go over 1000 and not instantly get hit) but this is still a really good game and I highly recommend you buy it as long as you have the skills to play."

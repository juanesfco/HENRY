You have no choices and just play along as some made up guy with a BLACK TWIN SISTER! Im a white kid from outback West Australia! How is that giving me any choice? its the opposite to me. The gameplay itself is improved and alot more of a simulation. THe online is horrible. Noone on and lag, DC's.Still no create-a-team option to use offline in a season mode."

I do love the game and I'm having fun 3 hours in but the stuttering, horrible looking objects renderign in, not being able to bind lots of keys and a few other things just should not be there for a full release, near on full price game. In its current state it should be a $20, early access game. Now that would get people keen for a full release with all the promised features added instead of the negiative revies the brought on themselves."

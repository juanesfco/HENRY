,"Posted January 14, 2015.",,39120,No ratings yet,True,RIFT is a great MMORPG and very fun with friends there are lots of positive and negative things about this game and if you have friends like i said before its great and you should totally check this game out and if you don't have friends to play with i suppose you should check it out if you like MMO's so the final verdict for this game is an 8/10 its a great MMO like world of warcraft and also a very solid game but its not a WoW killer but either way the games F2P so why not and get it and try it out anyways

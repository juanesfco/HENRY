This game also serves as an educational purpose too. 10/10"

It has a different feel but a great story, full of must see events that will give you the hunger to play more. The dark decent and A machine for pigs are both great in it's horror ways, but A machine for pigs is a must play for scares, story and experience."

This game tried something different and actually did a fantastic job in my opinion. Worth getting but not to try out but to have an enjoyable space station janitor experience."

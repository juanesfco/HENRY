I yell at the gunner to shoot the enemy tank that I just spotted. He dosn`t shoot, I franticly look back to see what hes doing but all I see is his dead corpse. I franticly climb into the gunners position, line up a shot, AND BLOW THE T34 STRAIGHT TO HELL IN THE NAME OF THE FUHER.Then I decided to play RO 2, its a good game I guess."

It felt dull and boring compared to other call of dutys and the ending dident make you fell like you acomplished anything but in call of duty world at war, the ending was amazing and made you feel great!The multiplayer wasent great and it wasent bad, i enjoyed some of it.Dont get this, other cods like world at war are much better."

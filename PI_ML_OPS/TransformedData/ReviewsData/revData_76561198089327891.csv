,"Posted November 28, 2015.",,620,No ratings yet,True,"Portal 2 is a fun, enjoyable, clever, comedy filled masterpiece made by the geniuses at Valve. If you are contemplating buying Portal here is Shia Lebouf's Thoughts'JUST DO IT' -Shia LeboufSeriously though Portal 2 is an absoloutley phenomenal game, with an amazing story that keeps you motivated and enjoying yourself and with all the workshop stuff this game has enough content to last until Half life 3 is announcedand because of that I give this game the perfect 10/10"

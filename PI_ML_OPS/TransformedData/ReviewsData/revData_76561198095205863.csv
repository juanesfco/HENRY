When I turned around I saw a man aiming a water pipe shotgun to my head. He repeated himself, 'Drop the rock', this time strengthening the 'Rock'. I slowly went to my inventory and drop the rock. He then shot me in the foot leaving me to bleed out."

Just a little note that the tiger might be a little too hard to pass. The lighting on the mansion is amazing. I loved the heist! This game is very clever and-  I quit.

The mainproblen with the game is that bloody cooldown system. Whats it for ???!!!!Easy to catch on to, but hard to master"

Map layouts are great an fluid but cs_assault needs patching with the 'good spot :3'

Gamemodes are great and the workshop just makes it better, but the complexity of the tools can be a bit fiddily at first but just make sure u watch some tutorials before jumpin in to games"

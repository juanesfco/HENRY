But then again i only bought it for $10 on sale a few months ago and bought Gage weapon pack #1 and #2 and the courier mod pack on steam summer sale. $30 is a pretty average price for the game."

You choose whether you want to fight along through the struggle with people that are friendly other survivors or you can fight with people that kidnap, steal and kill other survivors (bandits) you choose."

This game needs so much development and it is not even up to alpha standards. Wouldn't mind getting my $'s back. Wouldn't play it if it was a free to play.

It is like most survival games where it is better to play with friends. I lke the rp aspect of game, sure the game still needs work but that is what alpha is. The devs are doing a great job so far.  10/10 IGN"

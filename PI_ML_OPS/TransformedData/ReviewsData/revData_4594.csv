Takes too long to get into a game.-Matchmaking - seems to be no other players-FUT (Fifa Ultimate Team- which is basically what this is) is much better."

,Posted February 9.,,319910,No ratings yet,True,"Trine3(D). If it wasn't called Trine, I'm sure reviews would be way more positve. The negative reviews seem more based on it being different to Trine1&2. This is really not a bad game at all. Hear me through...Firstly, play it with an Xbox controller if you have one. Game plays really well with it. The 3D concept is not too hard at all, is a nice twist on the previous incarnations (you can see they worked really hard to take the game to new heights, even if it misses a lot of the playability of the first two). I actually found the game too easy if anything.Pros: Graphics A++++, mostly good fun. Level editor. It's a cheap game (esp on sale).Cons: A little short (5-6 hours), missing level up RPG with character powers. Puzzles not up to T1/T2 (prob because characters are missing skills). Combat very simplistic. That ending?!"

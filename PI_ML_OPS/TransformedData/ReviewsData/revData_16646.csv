The writing and characterisation is great, makes you really want to shoot nazis. Also, the implementation of stealth was really well done: simple while still providing a bit of a challenge without becoming frustrating. And of course, you always have the option to just run in blasting your dual-wielded shotguns. Overall 10/10."

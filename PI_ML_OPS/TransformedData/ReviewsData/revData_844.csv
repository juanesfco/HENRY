,"Posted May 10, 2015.",,440,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"2,200 hours of pure ♥♥♥-kickin' fun! This is a must have for all people who have a steam account! People say ''TF2 is a CoD copy!'' and When they do I check TAB To see how many times this A-hole had been dominated. If you're just starting off I highly reccomend Soldier he is a Great Starting off Character. He has Decent Health and Damage and racist remarks that'll keep you laughing for days! If You want to be The favourite on your team Switch to medic and heal some folks or Equip Blutsauger, Medi-Gun and Bone-saw and just go full on Battle medic. A Great gamode to start off in is Control Point. It shows you how to get around efficently with great big maps. But whatever you do Avoid being seen wearing the gibus at all times unless painted. This has to be the very best F2P game there is. 10/10"

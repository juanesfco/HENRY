I Love this game so much, its such an action packed game with loads of adventure and depth, I have come across many different vehicles such as walkers, flyers, cars, and even hybrids  (A special vehicle with a mix of two different objects E.g: A plane with legs or a hover with wheels).  Great game overall, cant wait for the future updates to see what else FreeJam has up their sleevs. Overall, this game is definately worth that little bit of space on your computer."

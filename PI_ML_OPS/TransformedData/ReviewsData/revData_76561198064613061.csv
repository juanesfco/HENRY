Unlocking new ships, beating the boss, finding new ecounters. But when you get bored of the vanilla, you can download mods.There are mods for everything.Wanna stop the rebel fleet from chasing you? Infinte SpaceWanna harder game with harder choices? Captains editionWant the most overpowered ship? Zoltan OP modThis game is amazing and I 100% recomend it"

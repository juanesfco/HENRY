It is not worth it.Sadly Sean oversold the game as a yes-man in interviews. Again, do not buy.And Steam should do the right thing by refunding disregarding their return policy."

I bought this game when it was on sale because I knew I would get screwed over but not to this degree. Very predictable once you get past the honeymoon stage when the excitement quickly runs out....Now Beastman is $15 and blood is $2 (AUD)Game in total honestly is around $20 inc all DLC etc....

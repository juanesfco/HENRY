Very fun and very funny. Send your minions to build an underground base and hide it under a tropical resort while stealing artifacts and technology from around the world. Then use traps to keep those pesky secret agents away from the *real* base :)"

Randomised dice rolls that you have to prioritise and manage make for a very interesting game and very fun. The character perks add a decent amount of customisation to the game as well. Story is engaging, and the visuals are pretty good for a relativley simple setup.However, the random 'encounters' if you will, realy need to be tweaked. Having 3 events that remove 2 health each and require 20+ points to address is an instant restart. Or else watch your crewmen die in 1, maybe 2 turns.This game is fun enough to play, just dont expect any real progression until it has been balanced a lot more.Also- cut scenes are not skipable with the mouse. Mildly annoying, but dealable.Good game to get on sale at the moment. Otherwise... eh."

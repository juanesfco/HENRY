I got stuck in every tutorial past Chapter 2 and can't use the combo inputs for ♥♥♥♥e. Tried 'Sleepwalk' Story and Arcade, played as some weird failed lab experiment with a big ♥♥♥ saw coming out da butt. 11/10 at best, would be bothered figuring out how to play"

It's like Battleships, but with waifus. No tutorial, but the game isn't very hard to figure out how to play. One thing that bothers me is that your units don't move very far very quickly, but this game is a lot of fun"

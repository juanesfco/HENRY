,"Posted November 21, 2015.",,8190,No ratings yet,True,"What can I say about Just Cause 2to do it justice? Absolutely nothing. It is literally everything an open-world should be. Yeah, maybe the GTAs have had more sales, but this will always be the best carjacking open-world game. It combines all the gripping gameplay of GTA, with a far more gripping and compelling storyline. And grappling hook. That thing can do anything."

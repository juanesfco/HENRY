This game is worth $15 This game has one of the most beautiful yet most challenging game i have played so farYou just dont Craft a high tech gun or armor you sart as nothing and you have to work your way up to get it *or you mod it*and the Modding comunity is the best i totaly recomend getting on there fourms sighing up and downloading mods last of all its worth it by the time i have finnished this i have fell in love with the sound track and the game have fun!10/10 best game

,"Posted December 9, 2015.",,319630,No ratings yet,True,"Life is Strange is an absoultly amazing game about a beautiful girl named max who everyone seems to like. Except a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥. Then you discover that you have the ability to rewind time for short periods and it's time for those ♥♥♥♥♥ to pay...Hue hue hue. Despite the seemingly questionable school setting, there are many twists and turns to this story that kept me waiting impatiently for the next episode to come out. This game is truly a test of morals as well as some sneeky detective work which is why life is stange is considered an amazing game in my books."
,"Posted December 9, 2015.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"Great sandbox game with plenty of multiplayer games to play such as the hilarious trouble in terrorist town and deathrun. The amount of times I have felt literal pain from laughing too much from bsing in TTT I cannot count, Definitly worth it for the $10 I paid."

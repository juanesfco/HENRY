I know it is a Telltale Games Series but in the one game that I didn't expect to cry in I cried so hard that I had express my sadness to my friend... After that I realised I made once wrong choice and I ended up playing the whole game again... Only to cry again... 22 hours in 2 days...2 hours  of that was crying into a pillow... 11/10 would cry again."

I lost two crew members on my first move first game and then got killed the next turn... And the next game I lost all my crew members in three turns...10/10

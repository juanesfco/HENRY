I saw the first teaser for Tales from the Borderlands and thought 'what the hell are they thinking? Borderlands is a shoot-and-loot game! Not an interactive story!' I didn't think it would work at all.How wrong I was.The story was gripping and the gameplay did not disappoint. From the beginning to the end I couldn't tear myself away from it.10/10 would recommend to everyone."

,"Posted October 17, 2015.",,378649,No ratings yet,True,"The developers continue to set the bar on character and story driven gaming. The world is as incredible as always, the game still a joy to play. Nothing this year has come even close to the Witcher 3 + DLC"
,"Posted January 23, 2015.",,237990,No ratings yet,True,"Reccommended? Maybe - really nice design and art style, good concepts but quite poorly executed. Some fundamental control and camera issues and decisions made early on can result in a very difficult time towards the end of the game (inability to level up or get perks). Hope they do better next time around...."
,"Posted December 24, 2014.",,240760,No ratings yet,True,Took me a while to get into it but a good engaging game with lots of alternative approaches to any given situation. Impressive effort and certainly worth a play if your into old school rpgs.

I have never seen a dev team so open and dedicated as Wildcard. This game is by far my favourite of all time, a title that hasn't changed even once since I was a child.With more and more content released every week or two and the tweaks and optimisations along with it, I have the utmost respect for the team and this amazing game that they've made.ALSO: RIDING YOUR DINOS. SERIOUSLY. <39001/10"

Others say that it doesn't fit the character of XCOM... and what, the Blowout Hair doesn't?  I feel that it really captures the 'resistance spirit' of XCOM 2, and allows you to make some very interesting characters.Ultimately it's up to you whether a bunch of well designed props are worth $5 to you, but to me, it certainly was."

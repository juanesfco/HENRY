Over the years I have played them all but seem to find Dirty Bomb a breath of fresh air. The Mercs are fun, the loadout system is unique, the Devs (Splash Damage) and Publishers (Nexon) are really enthusiastic and supportive of the community as well as willing to listen to the players in shaping the game. In the end its FREE its FUN and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

I have waited a long time to give this game a review as I thoght it would be one of the best Naval action games but after servers disconnecting since the xmas update things just seemed to have stalled.  No real response from dev's except 'just post a log of your errors'.  If and when the bugs get ironed out of this game I would recommend looking elsewhere."

(GTX960)  If your system can handle it it can be a great squad based game, its no COD or BTField.  A very 1 shot 1 kill game. I hope the devs keep working on it, but till then advise to keep your pennys."

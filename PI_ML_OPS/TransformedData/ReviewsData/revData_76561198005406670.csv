But I took the dive and let the hype train come over me and boy, was this the right decision. One of the best games I've played this year and it is still in beta, now that is saying something.I haven't felt like such a part of a community since the WoW vanilla days but this brings back all those feelings again.BUY this game in beta, you will not regret it."

The story is also pretty ♥♥♥♥ and none of the main villains are memorable. Far Cry 3 attempted to explain how Jason became a stone cold killer. There was none of this in Far Cry 4. A man came to the country to scatter ashes and now he is fighting in a civil war. Where is the logic in that? I also really hated the ending.  You had to chose between  Amita and Sabal to lead the Golden Path. Both are horrible people. Amita wants to turn the country into a drug state, which will make money not feed the people,  and Sabal is a religious extremist who executes those who defy him. Why do I have to pick between two horrible people when I just won the civil war pretty much single handedly?"

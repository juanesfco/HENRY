,"Posted January 11, 2014.",,224260,No ratings yet,True,Not like Left 4 Dead where you can just run & gun No More Room in Hell has 2 modes Survival and Campaign Ammo is very precious and the type of weapon you mostly use could be a melee. Teamwork is needed to survive and NEVER GO ALONE or your possibly f*cked. Barricade to keep the safe zones protected no more just shooting zombies in the gut or d*ck and it'll die. This is a great Zombies Sim.

,"Posted July 19, 2015.",,245370,No ratings yet,True,"A great real time strategy. etherium has a few units and 3 races to chose from. each with their own units buildings and abilities. it has a unique weather system that could either help you or flatten you. the multiplayer servers arnt the best but are still functional. the ai is incredible! better than any other ai in other RTS games. there are a few bugs and gui issues in conquest mode, but overall its a great RTS.RATING: 4/5"

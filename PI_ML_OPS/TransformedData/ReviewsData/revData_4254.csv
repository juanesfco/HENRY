Fluid 2D animations, plenty of things to explore in terms of items, monsters, planets & other extra's. Sound is great, kudos to the composer of the soundtrack, plenty of worthy tracks to enjoy. Game isn't anywhere near finished in terms of content and it already feels like a very complete game with more than enough hours to pour into it. BEST $14.99 you could spend all year!"

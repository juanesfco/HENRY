In fact, one of the best survival sandboxes I have ever played. Even though it is in beta, it has a massive amount of content, and it is fequently updated, so there is never a dull moment. With the amount of opportunities available to the player, the possibilities are limitless. I personally, have had almost too much fun playing this amazing game.Also, I didn't mention the friendly and humorous team of developers that have created this wonderful gaming experience.I hope this review has helped you make the decision on whether to buy this game or not. I'm just hoping that you do buy it, and have tremendous amounts of fun playing it."

It ended up in my bedroom, which was in Communist Russia, back when the USSR ruled half of Europe.This computer contained one game. 'AdVenture Capitalist'.When I discovered how this computer worked, I discovered this fine Capitalism Simulator. I could finally experience the life of capitalism I had always imagined!I then waited over 50 years, until the great year of 2015 to see this game release on the PC.I am now reviewing it, just to say:10/10 would capitalise againTL;DR: If your computer travelled through time, I have it."

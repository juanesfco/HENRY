An introduction that sets you up for a lovely light puzzle platformer, with some exploration and light atmosphere, suddenly hits you with what could be mistakes for an action platformer, a'la Super Meat Boy. The controls here are slick, and the game always makes sure that you have all the materials required.And god this game is beautiful. Absolutely stunning.Do I recommend this game? You bet I do."

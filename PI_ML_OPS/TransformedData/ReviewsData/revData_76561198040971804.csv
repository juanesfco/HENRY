As a result a massive assassins creed fan like myself is now losing feelings towards the franchise because of it."

I have yet to get bored of this game and I feel like I've put so many hours already. Not to mention the fact that the developers still are creating new DLC to keep the game contemporary for everyone to enjoy themselves and have endless fun. Seriously a great game both casually and competively."

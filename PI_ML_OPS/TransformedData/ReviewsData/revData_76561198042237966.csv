The gameplay may be found fun by some people but the idea of kiting bullet sponges for a few minutes really, really doesn't appeal to me."

Also the pop culture references are really, really jarring and dated. No, Paradox Interactive, not everyone is a thirteen-year old who finds memetic pop culture references funny, and no, you aren't funny. It's still a much better game to pick up over Magicka 2, though, as ironically, its systems are much more robust."

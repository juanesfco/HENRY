Basicaly the only skill you need is the abbility to throw money at shity games or 2000 hours of free time. o yeah and theres tanks which your cant kill unless you are level 6 or some ♥♥♥♥ or money. so over unless you are a very rich man/woman this game is not for you. I say all this but i have 400 hours on warframe... but that games not pay to win :D.

,"Posted August 21, 2014.",,301520,No ratings yet,True,okay here we go.....well theres to many in-game purchuses and really i know the game is free but that could use some work also i like the war system and i totaly reconmend this to any of those creative minds out there but i think that the devs should add like a part that can move block like say an arm you could make it swing backwards and forwards that would be awsome :D

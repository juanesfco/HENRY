Highlights include: anything with Harley Quinn cos she's the best character. Graphics are sick too. The controls on PC are a bit confusing and takes a while to get used to the camerawork but overall it's fully sick."

It has amazing imagery, and an incredible story. If you like FPS and cool stories and BEING IN THE SKY then yes 100% this game is for you."

The graphics and combat is excellent, too. I'm also a bit involved in the story as well, I'm loving it. Haven't completed it yet, but will get there."

You can only play 3 characters at once and they've given you 7 so you have to play through three times to get all of the stories. My favourite are the ghost twins and the archeologist. If you love thinking puzzles like Portal then you'll love this too."

,Posted June 15.,,381210,No ratings yet,True,"This game makes me twitchy with the creepy atmosphere, it gets your blood pumping seeing the killer off in the distance and when you hear the heartbeat. This game has succeeded in creating a great 4v1 cooperative horror game. There are however a few issues which is mostly due to the people playing the game.First of all, campers at hooks, maybe the developers could make it such that the rate at which the entity kills you is slowed when the killer is around.Secondly, some games can be laggy due to the host's internet connection or sometimes, your own.Thirdly, at the moment you can't queue with friends as survivors however it has been said that that will be implemented soon.Fourth, deranking due to people disconnectingLastly, there are some bugs which weren't present in the beta that have appeared likely due to the new maps and killers.With all this said the game is worth it when you have friends to play it with as there is a private match mode so you can have fun hearing your friends scream and beg for mercy. Do note the game is skill based and you have to think how the survivors think when you're the killer and vice versa"

,"Posted September 30, 2014.",,230410,No ratings yet,False,"It really isn't all that free to play and sure you can get the same stuff by both farming and buying with real life money.However if you just cash for the right weapon you just wreck everything.Even for making things such as decorations for your clan you may require items that you might as well cash for.The game also forces you to buy weapon slots with your real life money so this game is pretty much p2w.However if you're willing to pump your money into it then sure it is fun get some friends,make a clan,cooperate and have fun"

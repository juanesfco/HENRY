Ever tried to rhyme Ulixsteracktus?'*Stands there and tries to read the names for about 10 minutes**dies by one of those small clockwork suicide bombers*10/10
,"Posted July 17, 2015.",,730,No ratings yet,False,"This game isn't fun anymore, its just hackers, smurfs, boosters and trolls (at least in Australia), I wouldn't recommend anyone to play this game, I've played 300+ hours and have hated the last week of playing it. If you do decide to play this game, be prepared to lose to smurfs, hackers and deranking teammates. Worst Community 10/10"

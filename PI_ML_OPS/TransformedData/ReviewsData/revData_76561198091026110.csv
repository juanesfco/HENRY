,"Posted June 17, 2015.","Last edited June 22, 2015.",222880,No ratings yet,True,This game is the amazing for anyone looking for a realistic tactical shooter. Everything about it is designed to make it as realistic as a computer game can be. It's still a relatively new game but it's getting better with every update. There are always plenty of games to join and the community is always friendly. Even if you are new there are plenty of people willing to help you out rather than criticize you. 8.5/10

An amazingling large open world with a brilliant economy. A game that you can loose days in getting no progress into the storyline whatsoever, i never have completed the story. You can become a successful trader, marry a princess, be apart of wars, become the most feared pirate of the carribean, have the biggest fleet. Its up to you. This game is a must play for any gamer!"

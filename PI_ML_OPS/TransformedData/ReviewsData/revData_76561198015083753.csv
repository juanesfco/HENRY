I dont understand how its got so many bad reviews Ive played for 60+ hours at the time of writing this and have not experienced a single crash.. Im guessing their trying to run this game on a potato..The only flaw i have found while playing is that it only has 3 server regions. EU, NA and RU. So if you're like me and live in Australia or Oceania you will have really high ping.. Ive actually spoken to an admin about this ingame and they told me more servers are in the works. So dont believe the reviews saying its unfair or unbalanced.. this is a game where skill matters.I'm able to play this game with 200-400 ping with out spending a cent and still place top 3 in matches..Do not play this game like CoD it will get you killed quickly.. Never peak around the same corner twice.. if you think another player has spotted you FLANK THEM!! Always try to trick your enemy.. If you try to run and gun you will fail quickly.. It obviously not a triple A title with a massive budget but what they have created is honestly something special. Play it with mates and you will fall inlove with the large maps and atmosphere.  "

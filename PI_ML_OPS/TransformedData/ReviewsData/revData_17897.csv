This expansion changes the feel of the game to the point I no longer felt I was playing AoM. In general however, I still enjoyed the game play. I still admire anyone looking to add thier own touch to this great game. For a very old game, I think that the team did well with the graphics and general look of the game. In my opinion, it is worth a shot at the sale price."

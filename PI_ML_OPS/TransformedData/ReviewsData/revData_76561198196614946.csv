The story mode is great not to mention the pretty awesome characters you can unlock. The free play is mostly the fun part of this game. If you enjoy your LEGO games you will definitely enjoy this :)

Having the DLC's makes this game super intense and playing it is ten times more fun. The vehicles haven't really changed much, although who needs cars and planes when you can sprint and glide around the city. The story is quite great and the gameplay just seems to get better and better. A must play for all Saints Row fans. 10/10"

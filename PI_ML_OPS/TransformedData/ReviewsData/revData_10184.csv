The graphics were beautiful, the details of the environment are really intricate, and the game is really awesome. Although the parkour mechanics in the game are really difficult to master, it takes some time to getting used to it. I think this goes to show that Dying Light will be a huge success for Techland and Warner Bros.I have a feeling that this will be GOTY for 2015.1st time posting a review. No hate plz. :)"

The trailer lied. His mask looks pretty badass.- Micro UZI's good for stealth. Goes up to concealment of 32, which is nice.- YAAAAAAAAAAS! FINALLY! A ♥♥♥♥♥ KATANA! WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!- Perk deck's meh. Kinda useful for full enforcer build though.6/10 because of the Micro UZI and Katana. Buy it on sale. But if you want the katana, by all means buy it. What Jiro says when marking a guard:  KEVIN! "

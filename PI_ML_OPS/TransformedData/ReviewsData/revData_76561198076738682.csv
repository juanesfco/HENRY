This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time. Have fun!"

I loved this game, the sad thing is that it only took me 2 days to finish it. Since i did get the DLC things i played as the criminal, his story was pretty sad. Anyways, this game is just amazing. You should tottaly get this! 10/10"

Combat system is strange but is still sort of playable in a way...Fighting against players who have way more experience against someone with low hours is really the worst.

Although i did enjoy it a little. I would say you should buy this game if you don't like seeing yourself reload and you like games where you can shoot, build and survive."

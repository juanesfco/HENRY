,Posted May 18.,,281990,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"pros:- very indepth- time accelerate for when thuff take too long- very usable HUD- looks pretty, runs great (and i mean high, 1080p on intergrated grpahics :)- game plays fluidly- loads of different playstyles, all promoting different things- multiplayer works surprisingly well (and up to 32 players :)- also with MP games you create are hosted on matchmaking servers, so no stupid port-forwarding.Cons:- sometimes AI is stupid / does things that don't make much sense- have to micro manage a bit too much (if a ship encounters an obticle it doesn't try to find a way around, it just sits there- combat is slightly luck based (enough to make me lose a couple of battles I really shouldn't have- nothing tactical involved with combat (no manouvers or anything to help, its just straight up stat vs stat)- the grpahics for battles look like an elaborate dance more than a battleOVERALL:I highly recommend this, its very fun and indepth. most of the cons I mentioned the devs have hinted that they would like to fix so no worries there."
,Posted June 2.,,259700,No ratings yet,False,The core concept is neat but it is so broken it took me over an hour to get a game with my friend and another 2 hours disconnecting and reconnecting... The game was just posted on steam and then never improved.

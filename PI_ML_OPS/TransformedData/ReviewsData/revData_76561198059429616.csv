It combines everyones secret wish to fus ro dah chickens, eat sweetrolls, kill dragons, clear dungeons, frolic in the open world and complete both side quests and a spectacular main one! Now that i think about it, its probably the great and ever expanding modding community that keeps me glued to my computer screen even after nearly 2 years of play! So take the little advise ive given you and buy skyrim, get some mods and dlcs, join the stormcloaks, go to solidute and complete the 'mad god quest', play for another 500 hours and blah, blah, blah...[10/10]'CHEESE FOR EVERYONE!' -Sheogorath."

(i am still a fan of Battlefield.. and the majority of other fps games xD) Well... let me just stop you there! This is more than your average 'call of duty' affair right here. You see, within this game is hours and hours (222 hours judging by the amount of my life ive already wasted) of brilliant gameplay! Limited only to your logical ability as you play the game over and over again whilst testing your strategy and determination all while being able to play with ai or friends!You will play this game... AND HAVE FUN! [10/10]Better yet, you will leave smarter than the average man!"

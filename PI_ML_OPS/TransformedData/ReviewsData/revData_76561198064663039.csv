THE GUNS, THE STUFF AND THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING EVER, THE F'ING LICENCES!!!! YOU CANT KILL EM, CANT TRACK EM, AND THE GAME IS A DCK BY SAYING YOU DONT HAVE A F'ING LICENCE!!!WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL THESE STUFF, THIS IS A FREE GAME, IT COULD BE $20 DOLLARS AND INCLUDE EVERYTHING LIKE PRIMAL!Overall this game is just the most frustrating thing ever when you can only hunt deer and cant get any guns unless you paying the things that dont need to be there. If its free make everything free. If has content that you have to pay change the price tag on the game so the content does get included with that purchase.The most realistic game with the biggest let down 4/10"

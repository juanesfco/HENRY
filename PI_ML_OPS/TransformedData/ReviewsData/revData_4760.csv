I reccomend it to everyone; except people that hate the following: losing, feeders, Russians, the Chinese, people that think they're better than they are, people who think they're worse than they are, 10 hour downloads, good grades, an education, spare time, friends, girlfriends, other people, bad games, good games, exercise, social situations, supports that feed, carries that feed, overpowered carries, noobs on your team, pros not on your team, Pyrion Flax, absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and getting completely stuck for over five seconds whilst being beaten to death by a supremely overpowered carry that doesn't even have a face.10/10 would download again."

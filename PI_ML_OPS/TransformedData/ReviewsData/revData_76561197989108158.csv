,"Posted April 16, 2015.",,730,No ratings yet,True,Wouldnt think that valve could create a good game. CSGO is popular now and is very good with more modern weapons than it counter parts CS CZ CSS. But what i think makes the game good is the ability to add custom skins to all weapons including knives. The down side to the game is the competitive side the elo system is broken and theres players not in the correct ranks so it does make ranking harder to gain unless you play with higher ranked friends in a team.

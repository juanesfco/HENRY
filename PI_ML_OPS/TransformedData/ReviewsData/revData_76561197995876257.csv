If you have a 360 controller you might enjoy this title but for those who do not have a controller the ♥♥♥♥ poor keyboard controls and the inability to map them myself instantly put me off this title and to add to that the bugs and glitches feel alot worse than playing the original titles.for the hardcore group you may get a kick out of this but for everyone else I suggest you stay away.

It had a great stroy behind it was well as many plot twist's you would discover along they way based on your actions. I deffinatly recommend this game to everyone but if your abit of an affectionate sort of dude/gal this game will hit you in the feels very hard.It did for meHOI

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building type games with a bit of combat mied into it :)The only thing that will probably bother you is that this game is integrated into uplay(not sure wether that has been changed) which may irritate some users since you are pretty much launching the game through  two game managment programs.

,"Posted December 19, 2013.",,219640,No ratings yet,True,Think team fortress 2 except instead of a heavy you are a knight coated with armor armed with a razor sharp longsword ready to gut your enemies. This game is enjoyable to play becuase the ways the weapons work differently and each one has its own unique way of striking at your enemies. New players might get abit frustrated at first but once you get used to it it becomes  an enjoyable experiance.

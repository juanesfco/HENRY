,"Posted August 17, 2014.",,67370,No ratings yet,False,"Absolute waste of my life. First of all (despite what it says on steam), The Darkness II has not yet been optimised for Mac computers which is an absolute let down/waste of money. Don't get me wrong, i'm sure that the game is great, but from what i've seen so far playing on a high spec mac computer, is a pile of ♥♥♥♥. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game unless you are 100% sure that you have a working PC and not a mac. I want my money back you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

That after 4 hours of fun and awesome gameplay Chivalry now comes up with the message 'UDK.exe has stopped working'. Now this is really frustrating i mean i tried the usual: Uninstall then reinstall but of course that didn't work. Torn banner please fix. But for the 4 hours of fun that i had playing this game before it crashed. I am going to recommend it and I hope other players have fun playing this game just as long as it doesn't crash. :)

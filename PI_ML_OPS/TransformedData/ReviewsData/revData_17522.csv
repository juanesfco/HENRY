I spent every single spare minute i had playing TF2 back before 2013. Then it got meThis game sucked me into the Black market hat trade. I couldn't stop, but eventuly i was able to break free of constant trading and buying. I got back to the real game or; what was left.When i returned to actual servers and to re-learning classes i quickly discovered how much the game had changed. No longer was it 'TEAM Fortress 2' but the whole get-up was more Counter Strike than anything else. Valve had robbed me of my true love for this game. The addition of Killstreaks, Gold Weapons, way to many OP or UP Weapons and new and pointless hats made this game into what it is now.A Free To Play Call of Duty/Counter Strike Clone.Don't get me wrong, i still like this game (Why i gave it a thumbs up) but i just don't LOVE it anymore.Thanks Valve, for ruining a VERY good and DIFFERENT game."

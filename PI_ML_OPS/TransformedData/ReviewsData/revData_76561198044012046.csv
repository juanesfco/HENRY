,"Posted May 13, 2014.",,48700,No ratings yet,True,I've played this game for hours at a time and still never get bored of it. The sandbox open world feeling it has to it really makes Warband a great game. Would recommend this game to anyone who likes medieval sandbox RPGs.

I like this game because it allows you to free roam around Paradise City to get you to the start point of a race, there are also heaps of crazy jumps to be found around the city. Burnout Paradise also has the option to go free roam ONLINE with all of your friends! Great game."
,"Posted February 14, 2012.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"Really funny stuff! Great game for people with a humorous imagination, fun game to play with your mates. I like just about every aspect of this game, except some controls are a bit complicated. NOT FOR DUMB PEOPLE WITH NO SENSE OF HUMOR. Lots of props from games like TF2 and the Half Life series. 8/10"

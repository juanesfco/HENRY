The things that got me were the: - Epic Storyline where you define the world around you - Awesome FPS gameplay combined with RPG elements, creating a diverse and interactive world - Make your own war, do what you want when you want - The end is never... even at the end, you can continue with the epic world!So trust me, this is a game you will never regret buying"

Amazing story, beautiful but simple world, characters with personality, amazing music and exciting but puzzling platforming. I would recommend this to anyone, especially players of Portal and The Stanley Parable"

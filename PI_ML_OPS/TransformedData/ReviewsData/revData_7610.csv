I'm still chopping trees down and not getting bored. I admit the game is very buggy and unstable with lots of hackers but they will fix that soon. Once they fix everything the game will be even better! Then they can start editing and adding more items, and features. Dream features: Have to kill the king before claiming the throne, or at least have a option as a server owner.Be able to go down the castle, not just walk up the sword and into the head.Npcs roaming the castleA bigger mapMore monstersMagic somehow ? Be able to make your character as smeagol/golemHave some weapon/item references to films and or books.Allot more options as a kingBest game Ive played in a long time."

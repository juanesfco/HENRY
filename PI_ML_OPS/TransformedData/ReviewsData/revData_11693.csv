Freejam are not a bad company, but when they release a 'game changing' update, they 'change the game' by removing more features than they add. I can guarantee that around 98% of all veteran pre-new-meta players have left the game in their past. Granted, I liked the new meta, but everything that followed was just horrible. Post-meta players may like everything that followed because they were new to the game - they didn't really care what was changing.What I'm saying is that instead of growing their fanbase, Freejam simply gets rid of the old one and gets a new one. Most of the old features we loved have been removed. Seriously, the only things that remain are the weapons and the maps. Blocks, tiers, gamemodes, electroplates, building, fighting, flying, driving, working together, communicating, nearly everything you can think of has been either removed or manipulated so much to the point where its unrecognisable.I'm not gonna ask Freejam to fix this, as it is too far gone."

This game is really intensive on Mac and requires the latest iMac to run.My late 2013 iMac runs it only just at lowest graphics settings."

What really stood out for me was the Soundscape created, the musical cues when about to be attacked by the Darkness to the muttering of the Taken themselves were some of the best I've heard. A real world was created here, which was fully fleshed out. Whilst the game isn't overly long, a couple of the episodes dragged with continual running down a path and Taken spawning every every 30 seconds, diminished the threat a little.Great game, one of a kind."

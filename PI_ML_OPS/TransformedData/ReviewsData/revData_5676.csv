,Posted January 7.,,296710,No ratings yet,True," what i can i say,if your looking for that alien isolation/soma immersive fear that you will hide yourself inside a locker for hours to scared to come out .......then this game is definetley for you . the A.I is good ,i also reccomend trying it with oculus dk2 i mean WOW it messes with your perception and you feel like your really creeping around a rusted up ship in the middle of nowhere .......alone . with use of the oculus i rate it a 12/10, but running it in 2D i rate it 10/10 great game"

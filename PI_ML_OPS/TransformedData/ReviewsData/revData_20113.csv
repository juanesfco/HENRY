Before life is strange i had never really liked any story games, just stuck with cs:go and Team fortress 2. But this game is different. You really get wrapped up in the story, you start to act like and believe that you're max. I've only played episode 1 so far and i'm already addicted. You may think to yourself 'but i hate games that require's puzzles and brain power!'. well, that doesn't matter. I am stinking terrible at puzzle games and i still found it enjoyable. So in conclusion, do I think you should get this game? Yes, For sure. Am i saying that you'll love it no matter what? No, i'm just saying from the pov of someone that typically only like FPS's, This game was a pleasant surprise.Peace out, and if you get the game, have a good time playing it, i hope it was worth your money :) ;)."

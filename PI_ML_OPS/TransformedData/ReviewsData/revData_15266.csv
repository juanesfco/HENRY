,"Posted September 11, 2015.",,550,No ratings yet,True,"Left4Dead2 is possibly one of my favourite games on steam and one I enjoy thoroughly when I play it with friends however whenever I've joined a community game if I've made even the slightest mistake people end up treating you like you're worse than trash. That is possibly the only negative about this game but I still hope that maybe some people who take the game too seriously will grow up and realise it is just that, a game, not a competition where you'll win prize money but a freaking game."

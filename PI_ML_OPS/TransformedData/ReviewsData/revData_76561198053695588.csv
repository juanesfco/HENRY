You can build anything you want if you are a builder, or you can enjoy cool monster and boss fights if you like the dangerous side of the life (YAY). I've got over 1000 hours of gameplay on Terraria, like playing alone, editing custom maps and multiplayer co-op adventure or PVP. This game is awesome. With a awesome team working on its mechanics and sprites, and the great community that the game have, you'll feel like you're at home. I give a 10/10, cause it's completely awesome!PROS: - Boss fights!- Game biomes make it always different.- NPCs!- Every world is different.- +1000 ITEMS!CONS:- Finite worlds.- Don't have a story.- Don't have a local 'Creative Mode' (you have to download a certain Mod)- Don't have QUESTS (actually there is a new Angler NPC who asks if you can catch certain type of fish, but I mean REAL quests, like the RPG ones)"

If u have a microphone, USE IT. There IS good people in this game who u can trust and make alliances. You just have to talk and be a little lucky. I play with a clan and we have an alliance with some american guys (me and my clan are brazilians) who live next to us. This is better in case of random threat. Everybody can help.AND YES, everyone knows that THERE IS some hackers/cheaters in this kind of game. Try to 'CTRL+R' with your crosshair at them. It is the 'Point and Report' feature. Don't forget to click on 'Report last death' in case of dying.This game is pure fun. I like it a lot.Take care, new survivors (:"

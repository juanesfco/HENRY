,Posted August 5.,,71340,No ratings yet,True,A perfect celebration of all things Sonic- my only criticism is how little control is afforded by the character's crazy acceleration relative to Adventure 2.

All in all, buy if you want to play it 2-3 times and ignore it after, that's what I did."

,"Posted July 13, 2013.","Last edited November 25, 2013.",220860,No ratings yet,True,"Urinating on fires to stop explosions has never been so fun! In this retro-styled point and click game, your objective is to stop something from exploding within a twenty second time limit by kicking, punching, breaking, drinking and peeing! Overall, a very funny game that was impossible to put down until I'd finished it.5 / 5 STARS"

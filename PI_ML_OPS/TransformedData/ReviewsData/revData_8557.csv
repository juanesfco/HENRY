Ive reviewed Estranged and No More Room In Hell yet and Half Life:Before. Now onto Synergy. You can play Synergy if  you have a game using the Source engine. So thats HL, CS etc. It is a Co-op FPS in well-designed levels. The shooting is great. However the main problem is replayability. After a round of having fun, I got bored with the same mechanics.If you want to have fun in this game, play it with friends using voice chat. Otherwise its a5/10Average"

You get to play as either the zombies or survivors.Game modes are creative and you get used to the mechanics,Its a fun game.6/10"

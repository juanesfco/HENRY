Maybe I'm just stupid, but, I'm probably not. You know what else is hard? Running this game. An overvolted i3 and an overclocked GTX 750 can run this game at around 50 FPS on absolute lowest settings with 'Sky Effects' turned off. The input lag because of this is bad sometimes, but it's understandable, because the world sises on this game are massive, and the graphics, when turned up a bit, look great. Really wish I could run this better, but overall it is fun as heck."

It's difficult, it's challenging, but it's fun as hell, and now that it's for Windows AND Mac, unless you're on Linux, then there is no reason not to play it. No HD space left? Tiny 50mb download. Computer too slow? This game runs well on crappy PCs. Just play it. Trust me."

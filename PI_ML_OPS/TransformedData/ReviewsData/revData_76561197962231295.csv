,"Posted October 28, 2014.",,241930,No ratings yet,True,"Outstanding ! It combines much of Assassins Creed good parts with the Batman franchise type of fights! The storyline is solid and magnificent, the villains and characters are truly well fleshed out, sidequests are fun to play as well and it's well optimized on PC."

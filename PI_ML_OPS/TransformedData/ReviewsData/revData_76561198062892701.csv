You spot what looks to be a merchant ship in the distant. 'Send them a welcoming gift,' you command. As your weapons power up slowly, the intercom suddenly switches on. A desperate voice is heard on the other side 'We will give you everything! Please just spare us!'You ignore the plead and shut off the communication. Your ship send an explosive barrage of lasers and missiles. As the bloodstained wreckage explodes in space, you think to yourself. You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villian. This is Faster Than Light."

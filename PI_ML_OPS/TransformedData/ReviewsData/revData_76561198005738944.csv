I enjoyed but wasn't vacuumed into an action. I played 3 levels and get a bit tired of the a bit repepetive form. But then the forest was set on fire. Another thing is Nurture. I played it for about 10 minutes. I've found some food for kids and explored the forest. I hunted down a fox and turned it off. Then after more then year I returned to the game. Aaaan... Day 619. My kids vanished on my own eyes and although i was still in the forest I felt like a Mad Max in the Wasteland.Never forget about your kids!

Valve, take care, give at least one duck about Half-Life 3. Or Episode Three at least. This ending was cruel for gamer.P.S. Ducking dwarf. I hate him."

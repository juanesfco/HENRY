Would be good to have a button to stop the cue moving left or right for more accurate shots but maybe I just missed that one, will check options later and update if so."

Also the map system is horrid by todays standard, but maybe I'm just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where I put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesn't pause the game.Other than that the engine is pretty good (apart from previous stated bugs/glitches that have occured) the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up (drugs for keeping it up in the field) and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as WHERE the base is, and set up outposts. Driving is rather easy but I hate hatchbacks, too weak. Seems like a step up from Project Zomboid, but when ProjZomb gets things like survivors and hopefully a better server browsing system the tables might turn."

Or you can just kill them.Mad with your parents, why go to jail? Play GTA V instead and work out your rage the healthy way...the way your dad did in the day. The way your grandfather would have, but didn't because he didn't have video games, so instead he contributed to the crime statistics in real life.Violence crime has been going down for the last thirty years, why? Video games that's why!!Help keep those crime stats down. Play GTA V today."

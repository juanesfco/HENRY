,"Posted October 4, 2014.",,47810,No ratings yet,True,"As someone who owns this game on both console and PC, icluding all DLC, I feel that the PC version is definately the best way to go, with mod support, better controls such as a topdown view of the screen, and a great deal more challenging. Beyond that, this is your typical Bioware RPG. Great stories, both overarching and personal (though the main plot is admittedly quite generic, nonetheless it is well executed), great dialogue and great replayability. Definately recommended."

,"Posted November 30, 2013.",,206420,No ratings yet,True,"The graphics are pretty much the same as SR3, but honestly, who cares about graphics when you can fly, run up building and throw fireballs at ugly aliens. The controls are perfect and within 5-10 minutes you pretty much have enough practice to land whatever and wherever you want. The best one yet."

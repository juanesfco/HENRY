I dont just not recommend this game i dont even know why the **** it was even eccepted through the steam greenlight what why 1 vote of a guy that has 9 accounts and works for rockstar games? i have said all i will say if you want 100 more reasons on why this game sucks **** add me as a friend and type to me 'i want 100 reasons on to why this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game sucks* thank you Also for a cheaper and better version of this game just use the GTAVOnline gamemode for garrys mod its pretty good and $80 less.

HOST! it needs a host button! because all the local servers are either pvp/laggy/lost of people and me and my friend dont like that so, games good keep updating but add a host button! it would help alot! thanks                                                                                                                                        -CBR1000RR"

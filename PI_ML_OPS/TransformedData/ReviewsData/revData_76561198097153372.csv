But, I do think this is a great game (at least the 1st episode was) and the gameplay is a well done, in my humble opinion. I am loving the story and can't wait to play the later episodes and recommend that you give it a try if you like Minecraft and Telltale's other games. It even runs well on my poor excuse of a PC :D"

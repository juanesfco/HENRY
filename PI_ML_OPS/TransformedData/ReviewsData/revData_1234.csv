For example I was playing a competitive game and the VOIP just randomly stops working. So I relog CSGO and then it wont let me reconnect to the match as it comes up with the error, 'Matchmaking Failed: Failed to connect to match'.Please Gaben fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game I dont want to deal with this ♥♥♥♥ anymore."

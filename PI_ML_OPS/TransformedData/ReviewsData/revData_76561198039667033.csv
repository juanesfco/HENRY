If you do, you'll be at Steam's mercy, likely to waste a lot of money on an inactive game like I just did. This integration is the worst I have ever seen, and although you probably won't notice any problems at first, you will, eventually."

It's incredible, really, everything has its own physics, everything is infinitely destructible, and it's very playable and addictive even with its basic gameplay! I haven't even gone outside creative mode, it's so much fun to make your own fleets in preparation for the eventual future warfare that may happen in multiplayer. Huge drain of resources, though, the large constructions I've been working on bring my GTX 770 and i7 4770k to their knees."

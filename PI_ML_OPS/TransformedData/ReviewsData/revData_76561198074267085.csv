This game was aimed at a specific group of people, plus the optimization is F**king putrid some people can't even load the game without CTD and some people even with GTX 1080s are having low fps stutters and dips etc , fortunately I haven't had many of these issues.  They lied about the game having multiplayer on release so none of that pvp stuff for you competitive people out there, planet generation is somewhat repetitive with some planets looking flatout the same and no gas giants so there's no sense of realism here. The creatures can look pretty intresting i might add, also even if this game had multiplayer they made the universe a bit too big so good luck finding your friends if they ever add multiplayer/coop, Trading is really good IMO but after you get to a certain point money can kinda become useless. Overall this game gets a 5.5/10, Great concept, very lacking final product. I really hope future updates change this.Edit: Now i'm getting Crashes at startup, TAKE THIS L NMSEdit: I absolutely hate this game after seeing the same planet over and over again? Sean murray lied to our faces.Edit: Trying to go for a refund hopefully I get it so I can spend it on something I can have fun with."

,"Posted April 17, 2014.",,221100,No ratings yet,True,I Love this game first thing when you spawn is you are close to a town and try to supplies it was funny when i went there i was in electro and i told a person to put his hands on his head so he did and he put his axe on the ground and then he picked it up and started to hit me i was loosing blood so i grabbed my farming hoe [weak weapon] and hit him 3 times and he went uncouncious so i hit him 3 times until he died this proves that the axe is not a strong weapon to players but overall best alpha ive played!

It might be a personal problem and im stupid, but if you know how it works, please tell me!over all, great game!(for singleplayer)"
,"Posted December 12, 2014.",,327890,No ratings yet,True,The life of a slice of bread who's sole wish is to become toast. Which would be fine if the things he needed to get toasted on were not on the other side of the room.An amazing adventure/physics/simulator that will engage you for hours of flopping a slice of bread around the room in funny ways.12/10

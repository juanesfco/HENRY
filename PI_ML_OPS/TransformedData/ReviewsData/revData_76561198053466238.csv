The story/ storys are all amazing and is even worth playing again once you finish it all. The battle system is basic so you dont have to take an hour to learn it. The selection of wepons, armor and skills are also great there is not one bad thing about it."
,"Posted June 12, 2014.",,266070,No ratings yet,True,This is a good game to those who need a brake from waiting on dungon partys all day and gold farming just to get end game gear. This game gives the players a chance to watch them selfs just relax to the filling of getting stronger it also has good selection of outfits and a nice simple battle system that anyone can learn in under five minutes. The people who complain and dont like this game are just people that want every game to be the same. Give the smaller games a chance and see what its like for your self before judging. p.s  sorry for any spelling mistakes.
,"Posted April 18, 2014.",,243870,No ratings yet,False,The game its self is great but the main and only issue i have is that there are no Australian servers. Finding a match isnt hard but staying in the match is what the problem is. I will keep on playing and hoping this issue gets resolved but until then if your Australian and have good or bad net you will have the same issues.
,"Posted February 19, 2014.",,242720,No ratings yet,True,This game is amazing its fast pase and doesnt take long at all to find a match. Due to being in early bata still there are quite a few maints but beside that i rate the game 8/10

You get to choose to be between a counter terrrist which are people that prevents terrorists from planting a bomb or using a hostage as bait, as terrorist is when you get to plant the bomb and try not to get the counter terrorist from defusing it or trying to get the counter terrorist away from rescuing the hostages. This game is a great way to make new friends and also experience what it is like, the graphics are unbeleivably amazing and the recoil makes it feel soo realistic. I strongly reccomend this game for 16+ people and hope its one of the best game you've ever played. (scammers,hackers will be on so a WARNING is NEVER TRUST ANYONE!)"

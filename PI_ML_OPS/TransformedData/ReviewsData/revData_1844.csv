But wait, Uplay was being an irritable, useless cuntmunch piece of software that refused to work, meaning the game was not unplayable, but unaccesable. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T MAKE IT TO LAUNCHING THE GAME UPLAY IS THAT SHITHOUSE. LIKE REALLY, I MEAN THE GAME ISN'T BROKEN, THE LAUNCHER IS AND THAT IS JUST ♥♥♥♥ING DEPRESSING. But yeah, ♥♥♥♥ Uplay amirite?"

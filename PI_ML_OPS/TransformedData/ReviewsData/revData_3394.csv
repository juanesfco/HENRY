Did the same at 1440p. Fun to play but definetly need to address performance issues. Great game.EDIT: Running the game in Bordered mode made a massive diffecence to performance for me with 2 monitorsAfter playing this game for a while, there is nothing bringing me back to it. It doesn't have much depth without multiplayer once you do a few of the first items."
,Posted July 15.,,436320,No ratings yet,True,Probably shows the best potential for a proper game on the Vive. Has an actual story and doesn't just feel like a tech demo. It's making me want to go buy a new video card. Throwing a blade like a jedi and maneuvering it mid air can never be bad.

They failed to mention that the videos go from an unbearable low res to acceptable, and it is extremely jarring and frustrating to watch. It was the only reason I purchased this app and can't find much other use for it considering I could use the steamVR desktop overlay with the controllers.A bit unfair to not recommend for a small part of a bigger program."
,"Posted June 13, 2015.",,346110,No ratings yet,True,Good fun and entertaining theme.A game that you are constantly scared of someone or something attacking you and stealing your stuff gets the thumbs up from me. It wouldn't be as much fun without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself when you see a T-rex charge at you. The farming can be tedious but that is all part of the game. Grind for a bit to get the satisfaction of creating what you needed. Needs better optimization and some bug fixes of course but it is still a ton of fun.

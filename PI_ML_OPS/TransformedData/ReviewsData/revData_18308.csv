Each class has its own unique ability such as flying, glowing and going transparent.There are so many things you can do in TF2. You can re-program automatic gun as the French Businessman, you can play a trumpet as US marine and can even go shiny as a dentist.Ruined my life - 11/10 - would recommend to friends and family"

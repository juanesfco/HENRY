For your first disciple you get to choose between a water, fire, or grass disciple. Then you need to visit professor John the Baptist to activate your disciple-dex.  I would recommend, when you speak to your mother, to not let her 'save' some of your battle earnings, as you will need it later for trainer battles. 10/10 - would go to heaven again."

You need to drink You need to eat. You have dissentry.  You need to find a way to cool off.  You are wet.  If you like being constantly nagged at about every article of clothing you are wearing, and zombies, you'll love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. 10/10"

There was a variety of characters to choose from and each character had its unique abilities and personality. The game had a detailed map which allowed the players to freely roam through. This MMORPG, in my opinion, is better than league of legends or any other, ranging from its resolution, gameplay, design or soundtracks.Overall all, Dota 2 is one of the best MMORPGs out there and i definately recommend it.

Encountered that loading screen **** 30minute loading times, seriously???? after I got past that i played with a friend, and the game was better than my expectations, I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH BANDITS, maybe im just too professional or if this was to happen in real life i would be a survivor...overall good game for under $5 and if you have a few mates, why bother playing solo."

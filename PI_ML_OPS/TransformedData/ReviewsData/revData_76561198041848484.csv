,"Posted January 23, 2015.",,201790,No ratings yet,True,"This is a fun, relaxing and sometimes stressful game, that puts the player in charge of placing traps, in a tower defence sort of style, to stop an on-coming horde of orcs. It has countless hours of fun and it can even played with another player allowing you to work as a team in keeping these orcs from reaching the end of their path. The weapons and traps can be very brutal and very satisfying. It is also intergrated with the steam workshop allowing you to mod the game for more fun! It is definatly something I'd recomend to everybody but in my opinion, it is best with a friend."

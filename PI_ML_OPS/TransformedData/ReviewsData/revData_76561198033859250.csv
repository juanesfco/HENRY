Although the performance is perfectly fine running at 1080p 60fps, there is a game breaking bug where the game refuses to save and instantly corrupts any auto-saves made. As there is no definitive solution for this glitch, this makes the game broken and unplayable.Once this issue is resolved, I will be changing this into a positive review."

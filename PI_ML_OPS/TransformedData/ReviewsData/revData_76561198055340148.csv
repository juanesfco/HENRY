As i was about to get off my life raft a tiger shark rams me and knocks me and my precious coconuts into the water..... as you can tell the shark and I did not share coconuts while sitting in hammocks in the sunshine.. he tore me limb from limb until the pacific was red with my blood. but seriously this game is fun already even though i suck and keep dying. 10/10 to me :D"

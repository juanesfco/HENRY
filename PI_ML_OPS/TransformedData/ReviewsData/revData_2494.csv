What much more comes to mind than an amazing Post-apocalyptic rpg fest full of breathtaking locations and stunning scenery! after clocking 5Hrs on the work of art i can safely say that i find this is going to be a hard game to get off when the time comes.... 'Oh just one more mission' will probably be a common occurance during fights between parents and children. I Originally pre-ordered this game for Xbone but changed my mind to the PC Version shortly after, I Then sold my Xbone and now am left with a Game that i cannot run to its full potential, (16Fps on Low Sett) :/But all in all this is a beautifully created game and i Praise the team at Bethesda for making one of my all time favourite games better!! Muh love ~Ethan!"

However it is CoD, they have nailed the FPS formula hence why most if not all games since CoD 4 are very similar. Graphics look great (when on Ultra) but you'll need a beefy PC for Riley's Nvidia Hairworks and Antialiasing. I'm running an i7 6700hq with a GTX 970m and 16GB DDR4 rig, on mixed settings between high and maximum i can get 55-60 fps.7/10 buy only when $25 or less."

Turned everything up as far as it will let me (which isn't far), and getting very solid frame rates. (Running an i7 6700HQ, GTX 970m, 12GB RAM). Game looks great, audio sounds great. The remaster done is well, but not properly."

Nazi zombies are what devs use when they have no ideas3. Very short (i finshed it in 6.3 hour and i was lost alot of the time)4. the boss (if you can call it that) is weaker then a nanny with cancer5 I rate it a decent score of 5 outta 10 because its gameplay is not too terrible but still i bit terrible to the point that i am typing this upTo sum it all up its not worth your money and you should get the other wolfenstein but just not this one because like i said it is AWFULp.s i got this for free when i pre-ordered Doom

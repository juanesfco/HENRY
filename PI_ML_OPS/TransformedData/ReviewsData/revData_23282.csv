,"Posted August 14, 2014.",,24960,No ratings yet,True,Great Game I like the Multiplayer and the campaign. There is great destruction you can fly helicopters drive tanks. But the only downside is that the leveling up system is very slow. Unless you are a very good player then 1 hour og game will fill up only one quarter of your leveling up bar.

All they are doing are adding new skins so you can waste your money on more useless crap. The ranking system is crap, because it is nearly impossible to rank up and if you lose just one game you go down a rank.Go and play another game, just not bloody cs go."

Definetley get this over any FPS on steam or on pc. Bad things is costs a lot of time and money to get just 1 gun, and about 2 mins of only 10 Frames per second when I start if the game abut about after 2 mins of playing, no lag at all.9/10 would buy"

Even though it's in early access, it's still aan amazing game so don't judge it too harshly. Just remember to save before you exit the game of you will lose all progress. The 'give feedback' optoin is a great addition to the game to help give the developers insight on what they need to still fix.Watch where you explore, there is quite the large range of fish and on the large end of the spectrum, there are quite the few, let's say, 'big' predators, but that's all the fun of it, just don't go too far especially not at night or you may not return... and only travel to the crash site with extreme caution.Good luck and safe exploring and let your underwater journey be filled with excitement and boat loads of fun (pun intended)"

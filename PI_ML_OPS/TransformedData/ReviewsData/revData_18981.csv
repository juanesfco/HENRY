But what really makes this game worth getting is the story. It separates itself from other shooters because it forces you to make tough choices and dosen't shy away from the brutality of war and loss of life on a massive scale.It's a game that really makes you think about your actions and makes you contemplate the horrors of war in the real world.Having just finished the campaign, i'm keen to play through again to see the alternative endings.3.5/5 rubber chickens"

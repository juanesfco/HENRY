One of the biggest changes to Rust was the rad zones before on the old Rust rad zones were always the most heated zones as they were always being contested now there are simply no rad zones there are barrels which are spread out throughout the map and there is always the occasional air drop every know and again there also made guns more rare which i love because starting as a fresh spawn in the old Rust and trying to get resources i often found myself dying over and over again to people in full kev but now i just mostly see naked men with bows running around. All i have to say is that the new Rust is what a wanted from the old Rust as it improves all the features from the old and makes its a loveable game again.

Even though this game was released in 2013 i expected more from sega i rather play jak and daxter on the ps2 i still have more fun buy this game for lols or just with friends. 3/10

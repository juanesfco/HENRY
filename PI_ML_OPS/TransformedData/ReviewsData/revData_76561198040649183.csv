The Golden Horde is a bit unfair, the combat system lets the game down when fighting an army that's larger. The Mongolians are incredibly unfair and very hard to beat. All in all a very well polished and assembled game. The DLC really make the game better. The mods are some of the best mods i've ever played or used."

I am not really good and strategygames like this, but even with that in mind, this game has it'sdifficulty. Before I get to that, I found the graphics and music ofthis game to be fun and enjoyable, but the game play is slightlyunbalanced, but in the early levels of the game, the grenadiers are abit to difficult. You really don't stand a chance, however, thefreeplay matches are actually somewhat enjoyable.The level creator is fun, and is well designed, I would recommendmaking some of your own levels for gameplay.Overall, the game is fun and challenging, to good generals this wouldbe fun and it has replay value.Overall 7/10But 3 Sprockets have made a sequel to it and I haven't tried it outyet but it sure seems better than the original"

,Posted September 9.,,23310,5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful,False,The plot is pretty short and the developers have used the difficulty of game to make you invest more hours into the game so you can unravel the plot at a slower pace.Only get this if you find it in a bundle for a dollar with other games included.

Took me 20 minutes to find an enemy camp while free roaming.The world is too empty unless you play the main missions which places enemies in areas where you can locate them easily.Final rating 4/10"

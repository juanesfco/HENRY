,"Posted June 22, 2015.","Last edited June 22, 2015.",38720,No ratings yet,False,Perhaps it could be improved by adding a fast forward button so you don't have to see the horrible cube spawn animation all the time and see if you actually did the puzzle correctly. Probably half the time you spend playing this game is watching the cubes do their thing than actually solving puzzles. 1/3. For those people curious on how i have 0/0 hrs is cuz i returned it

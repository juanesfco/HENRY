,"Posted July 26, 2015.",,301520,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,This game is a fun game. However with all the updates and additions to the game it has become confusing. You have to dedicate a few hours to learn the game. I rte this game 3 1/2 out of 5 plasma cannons.
,"Posted June 18, 2014.",,570,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,DOTA 2 (Defence Of The Ancients) is the best free-to-play game on Steam. It is a Magic/Strategy game that will keep you playing for hours. It is really good fun and is great if you are into Magic/Midevial. I rate this game:4½ /5  Elder Titans

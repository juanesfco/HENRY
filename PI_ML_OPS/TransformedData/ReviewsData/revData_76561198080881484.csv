,"Posted May 2, 2015.",,307780,1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful,True,"ok well to be frank its a good game. i really really like it and can see myself playing countless hours. i haven't played alot so i cant give a in depth review but from what i've played i can say this. its fun, the grahpics are amazing, the chataters play very difrently and the variation system works very well adding evan more hours to this game, the combat feels very fluid, however online is so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy, some charaters a just unbalanced, it is NOT worth the price at all, if your gonna get this game get it on ♥♥♥ for 30 dollars (goro pack inculeded) i would not recemend buying it at the steam price, however it still is a great game and i cant take that away from it. mabye a 7/10 might change if they fix the game"

At launch it was unfinished and lacked weapons that had become standard in video games, to fix this issue overkill put out DLC containing these weapons however instead of realiseing it for free people had to pay 5 dollars for things like grenades and snipers. The game has also done way to much DLC. Don't get me wrong everyone likes good DLC however most of the DLC is horible and ruins the feel of the game like honestly why whould a bank robber use a bow and arrow or ninja stars?"

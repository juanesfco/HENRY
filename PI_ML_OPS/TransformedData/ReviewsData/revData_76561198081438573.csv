,"Posted December 23, 2015.",,307690,No ratings yet,True,"Grand theft auto San Andreas in Hong Kong.I like the fact that they decided to substitute the giant Known shootouts in the Gta franchise for a run up to theseGuys and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them style. Driving is odd, and I hate that screeching launch soundEvery time I start driving my cars... It's gets ridiculously irritating and by all means,Please change it. Combat engine is intrusive and Wei Shen's Style of fighting is pretty bad ♥♥♥. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Gta But is getting sick of just blowing up their heads with Enormous Rifles. I'm sure a lot of people would find a game that allowsYou to beat the crop out of people very fun. "

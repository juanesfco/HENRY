There are MANY fatal flaws with this game. Don't get me wrong this is a fun game, but the developers are favouring more to the newbies and ignoring what really needs to be done to keep the game in a good shape:Pros:1. F2P2. very small (storage wise EG MBs and GBs)3. LOADS of items to obtain.Cons:1. Inapropriate bots (Swastikas, Genitals, Offensive language)2. Developers rarely care about people who have played for long times,3. Developers don't create backups/images of robots incase a fatal error happens4. Developers constantly change the way the game works,5. Developers try to make you spend money on the game so that you can paint your robots.6. people using languages other than the specified one in chat.7. VERY REPETITIVE.Overall the game used to be incredibly fun, but then they added things like aerorods, flak cannons etc.I used to rate this game 10/10 but now the game would be lucky to be even a 0.25/10 from me,waste your life on a different game, this game is not worth the time you would spend grinding constantly"

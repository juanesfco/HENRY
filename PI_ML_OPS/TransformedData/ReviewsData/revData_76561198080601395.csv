,"Posted April 2, 2014.",,8930,No ratings yet,True,Amazing game that obviously shines out of the usual bunch of strategy games. The hexagonal movement is good and how terrain affects movement and combat is superb. All DLC expands and makes this game more enjoyable and allows for a more flexible approach to economies and overall gameplay.

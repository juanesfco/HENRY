,"Posted April 23, 2014.",,231430,0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,At first I thought this would be the greatest WWII strategy game of all time. After playing the online for about an hour I find the game needs a few improvements (EG; Not having only the one team to have OP weapons/tanks and the other having ♥♥♥♥ all). Overall the game I rate is about a solid 7/10 due to the fact that they have just made the game harder and less items to have unlike COH 1.

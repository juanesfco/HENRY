Lots of weapons and mods but not that many armour pieces. Playing in power armour is fun. The voiced protagonist is a good touch.All in all a great game but with some flaws. 8-9/10"

Best Samurai Warriors game yet in my opinion. Thankful to Koei to bring it to PC. This game would be a perfect 10/10 but unfortunately the graphics are not on par with the PS4 and i severely dislike it when your character glows whenever your spirit metre is full. A positive though is that Koei actually listened from last PC port and increased the number of troops that are able to be on screen drastically so props for that! Good work Koei!

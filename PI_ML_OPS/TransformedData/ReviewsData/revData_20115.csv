There is humor at times that lighten the mood amongst most of the sad parts, but even then, it doesn't really take you away from the story. Heck I can even relate to it a bit, losing people...wanting to be able to fufill a promise...even wanting to go back and correct mistakes, but in the end it shows that even if things change, some things will always remain the same...even if it doesn't look like it now."

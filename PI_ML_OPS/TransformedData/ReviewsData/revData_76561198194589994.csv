I wish we had more DLC's though, like characters from Dragonball Super (Champa, Vados etc.) instead of having modders add them into the game."

It has a great artstyle, the game is easy enough to pick up, and its fun over all. I've definitely had my share of fun with this game and on special, its definitely a steal. Only complaint that I do have is that the camera controls can sometimes be clumsy."

If you're a huge fan of zombies like myself, then buy this for the custom zombies, trust me, its worth your money."

I tried using a controller which the game wouldn't even recognize so I couldn't even play it. At least the refund button worked."

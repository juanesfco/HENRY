I bought this game because of zombies and they took that and ♥♥♥♥ on it, while holding me down and forcing me to look at it, I cried, cried so much. After they finished letting the whole company of Treyarch ♥♥♥♥ on it, they then shoved my face into it, I am afraid some of the ♥♥♥♥ has entered me, killing me slowly. Now I sit here dying with Call of Duty Black Ops 3 shadowing all of my past mistakes. Hopefully at my funeral this will be a message for all of the children to stay away from the cancer that is, the new parts of Call of Duty franchise."

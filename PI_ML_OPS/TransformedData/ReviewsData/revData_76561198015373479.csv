The rebalancing of the old weapons system and the introduction of microtransactions was the last straw for me, where you now have to PAY for decent weapons with real cash, whereas before you could do a mighty fine job with the guns that came default with the game. Not only that, you aren't even guaranteed to get a decent gun even if you pay thanks to the 'gambling' system that is designed to milk you out of your hardearned dollar.Not to mention that some usermade mods were INTENTIONALLY broken. Hours of work from people dedicated to this game ruined because of the microtransactions update.This game is literally the definition of anti-consumer. Unless you are as rich as Donald Trump, and or are a Russian billionaire ganglord, you should avoid this game like the plague. (actually, even if you were as rich as them, you should still avoid this game. consumers arent cashcows like these swedish cucks believe)"

Severely past its prime, you should skip this game entirely."

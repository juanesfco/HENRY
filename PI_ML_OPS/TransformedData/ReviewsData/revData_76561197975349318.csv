Hero versatility2. Learning curve is steeper but more rewarding3. Games snowball less, but if they do its for the RIGHT reasons.4. Games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback.Overall, the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

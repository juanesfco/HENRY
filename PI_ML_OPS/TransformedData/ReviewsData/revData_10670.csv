I still remember back in 2013 that OVERKILL SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THERE WERE TO BE NO MICROTRANSACTIONS.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/I am not surprised at the amount of community backlash that has occured since then. If I could get a refund I would do it.Avoid this garbage, please."

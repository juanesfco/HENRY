,"Posted November 17, 2012.",,380,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,I want to recommend this game to all of the users of steam that have hl2 so you should get it. It also comes with a new zombie called the zombine which is a combine zombie. If you have garrys mod it gives you the magnusaun skin but the zombine skin is untextured. But all in all i think this is a good game so get it.

,"Posted December 22, 2015.",,72850,No ratings yet,True,"I got this game being the first game in the franchise ive ever played, which proves you dont exactly need to play the others to understand whats happeningPROS-(EX)= Expansion-Great Main Quests-Great Side Quests-Mods make the game awesome!-Hundreds of hours of content to mess around with, leaving you never bored!-Great Expansions which beef up the game in an outstanding way!-Choose your adventure-In Fallout they had Karma, im glad they scrapped it for Skyrim-Free Roaming is fun-Get married-Adopt Kids (EX)-Buy Land (EX)-Build Homes on that bought land (EX)====================================================================================CONS(EX)= Expansion-Being a vampire actaully sucks, if you cant find the cure, I had to reset my game because of it-The Mountains, are just, well it doesent happen as much but, they were annoying to climb and pass around and ive spent over 40% game time trying to get throughFortunatley, the pros make up for the cons, and I reccomend this game to anyone11/10"

,"Posted January 16, 2015.",,238460,No ratings yet,True,"The journey through the game was very fun (and very difficult), and made me laugh while also making me want to stab myself in the eye with a screwdriver.The ending was amazing, my friend and I were so happy we made it to the end, and also super relieved we didn't have to torture ourselves any longer. 10/10 - Make sure no charp objects are near when playing."

But The Result Of Which Is The Best Game I Have Ever Owned By Far With So Much To Do With Hours Of Gameplay I Have Barely Scratched The Surface Of What This Game Has Too Offer. Of Couse Bashing Peoples Heads In With A Baseball Bat And Then Jumping Into A Super Fast Car And Running Over Everyone On A Beach Is Still Alot Of Fun!

Bangs Everywhere, the heists also remind me a bit of GTA V online but without the, open world aspect so to speak. There is nothing more fun when you pull down your mask and spray down a jewelry store! 10/10 recomend to anyone who wants fast paced good graphics and a hell of a lot of fun! Also isnt very demanding according to my friends so I would buy at once! MUST HAVE!"

Graphics are quite good for the style of game and its not too blocky like other sandboxes. The destruction textures are stunning and it is awesome when you snap a ship in half and the particals go drifting into space for infinity"

,"Posted October 24, 2015.",,252870,No ratings yet,True,"This Review Was Made During Early Access. It May Become A Useless Review As The Game Progresses But This Is How It Is Right Now. currently There Are Only Three Quests Which Are.Get LootGo To Planet And Kill Aliens And Find Dead PeopleAnd Of Course, Flying Across The Universe And Killing People To Find Some Guy A Sandwhich.The Game Is However Alot Of Fun And Shows Alot Of Potential But As Of Yet Needs Alot Of Work Done To Keeping Players Intertained And Having Larger Questlines. The Chat System Works Well With The Ocasional Crash Of The Game Which Is Expected As It Is In Early Access. In The Future Of The Game I Think Having Player Vs Player Open World With Clans/Guilds Could Be A Possibilty. Sadly The Early Access Game Is Very Poorly Optimized With Some Of The Top Computers Getting Around 25 FPS On Lowest Graphics Which Is A Shame. Overall This Game Is Worth Its Price Tag So If You Are Into Open World Space Games With A Touch Of Combat And A Lot Of Exploration This Is The Game For You!"

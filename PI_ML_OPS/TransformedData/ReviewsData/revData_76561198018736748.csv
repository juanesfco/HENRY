But grinding gold takes a long time. First 30K is easy to get but after that it takes quite a while. The support EXP mission, way to hard to complete, my opinion, make it easier or make the reward greater so it is worth while. Other then that, great game!"

I have had this game for a while now, didnt play much but, after a few months it advanced a lot. To a multiplayer with 10 people playing to a massive Co-OP, just started Single Player Campaign, and a much bigger multiplayer with active servers and ranks going up to 100. Excellent for a early access... worth the money (imo). Love the CO-OP with the robots, quiet difficult but makes it fun.There is a lot to come... Check out their Hell Week for Interstellar Marines https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50AhVxkvIS8 Looking awesome guys :)"

SO INCREDIBLY AWFUL. there is potential but this crap should not be in early access yet. I know what early access means before you try to remind me, i know what I signed up for, but you at least expect some kind of quality of gameplay when a developer allows consumers to play their title. this game is a sham and a cashgrab at its current state. DO NOT BUY EARLY ACCESS, WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT PROPER. whenever the hell that will be."

BUT WAIT, its also minecraft.What a time to be alive."

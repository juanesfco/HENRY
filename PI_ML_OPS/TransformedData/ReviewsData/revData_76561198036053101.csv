,"Posted April 20, 2015.",,107900,No ratings yet,False,this game used to be one of the best third person shooters ive ever seen and I used to love it but now the servers are all dead and its a pay to win
,"Posted April 10, 2015.",,218230,No ratings yet,True,"this is a fps dream, you'll be fighting on the ground and you can look up and see all the aircraft fighting and bombing and you have to use teamwork to complete objectives, it has battles that consist of hundreds of players and it looks like a crazy light show, although it is a bit of a pay-to-win it has some cinematic battles."

,"Posted December 14, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,"A great game with many features, you can roleplay, play zombies, trouble in terrorist, and sandbox and much, much morethe only downside is that once you have bought the game you need to get Half life 2 episode 2 textures and counter strike: source to get the most out of your experience but otherwise its amazing."
,"Posted July 22, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,False,this game is great if you like games that tried to copy dayz in every SINGLE aspect so if your too broke to get dayz or arma 2 then this is perfect for you.

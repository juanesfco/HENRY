There no online play for one. But if your a fan of blazblue like i am then the missing features won't matter. Its Blazblue, It's on pc and i love it."

He acts all indifferent about it but he likes youBut on a more serious note, Xenoverse has pretty cheap combat. its more or less just button mashing. and the servers are constantly down. The boss fights can be really unfair too. but i would still recomend it.7/10"

However the story does invovle alot of back tracking. Be prepared to explore the same Hotel/Obseratory/Drive-in movie theatre over and over as the story progresses. Overal Its a fun little distraction while we wait for Alan Wake 2.8.5/10."

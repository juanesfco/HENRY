So when I saw KAG on steam, I was like 'oh boy a game that i liked better go buy it'. When it downloaded, I opened it and already ran into a bug; the game's window was bugged. I went to the options panel on the menu, but nothing. Nothing about fullscreen or the resolution, just controls and other nonsense. It took me 5 minutes to find on google that you had to change it BEFORE pressing play on the little window that pops up. Why not just put it in the settings? Is it some sort of limitation on the software used to create the game?So, after fixing up my resolution, I decide to play a little bit of sandbox. And god it's horrible. Back in the old time of KAG, it had a simple building layout, with 8 things on it. Simple and easy. Now you have all these wires and lamps and other bullcrap that don't actually need using.  WHAT THE HELL IS WIRE DOING IN A MEDIEVAL GAME, ANYWAY?  I couldn't even select things properly, they just select themself when you scroll over them. This is when I quit. Honestly, I couldn't give two damns about the community, I just want that damn build menu fixed. Until then, I'm going to have to give this a 2/10. why must you hurt me in this way "

,"Posted December 11, 2015.",,40800,No ratings yet,True,"After dying about 137 times, I got really close to the end of the level and then a saw killed me. I literally threw the controller across the room and it made a crack in the wall. My friend, who was watching next to me, told me to 'calm down, it's just a game'.My friend doesnt live on this spiritual plane anymore. i later tried the level with keyboard and did it first try like wtf game you said controllers would be better "

Fast-paced, frantic action, team-based gameplay, lots of player progression/ metagaming, plus MECHS. What more could one want?However, a word of advice for potential gamers in Oceania. Ever since the Raider Update of 2013, Meteor decided to shut down most of the servers in Oceania, so now, there's [literally] only 4 servers left... and 90% of the time, they're empty. So in order to play, you may have to look at another region (Say, US West) and have to face high latency."

Drone glitches into walls ( properties of drone and walls )3. When I land on some objects e.g tents, rocks, sometimes I instantly get reset.Other than those 3 fixes and the multiplayer button that is useless, amazing game.Also if your new to drone flying do NOT buy. This game/simulation IS hard and does take alot of getting used to."

THE EDGES OF STAIRS ARE A ♥♥♥♥♥ ( no offense )2. When I click the 'Find a Game' button it freezes. This did not happen b4.3. Some people lag massivly within the game when hectic. My friend just wants to play the game but he wasted his money to buy a game that doesnt even work on his computer. ( this game )4. Besides the crapload of glitches AMAZING GAME! Would defenitly recommend it... ... When it officialy comes out."

I cannot recommend this enough, and, my real life friends (I know right, rare) cannot shut me up about this game.This game beats me, and makes me feel useless, but then again, I could never stay mad at it, because deep in its heart, I know it loves me, well I think it does anyways, I mean it beats me because it loves me, you wouldn't understand."

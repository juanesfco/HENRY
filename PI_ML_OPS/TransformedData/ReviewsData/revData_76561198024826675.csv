It feels like there was no where near enough QA testing done before they released this, even several patches later I cant tell if anything has changed. The hardest thing to fight against in this game is the game LOTF.exe no jokeFIX THIS GAME AND MAKE IT PLAYABLE BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO RELEASE DLC!"

The story was meh... not bad but not good either, Game play is what makes this game good and as always in a DMC game the amount of difficulties you need to unlock gives some good replay value."

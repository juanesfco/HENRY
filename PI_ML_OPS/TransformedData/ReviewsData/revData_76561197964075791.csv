,"Posted January 22, 2011.",,9480,No ratings yet,True,Saints Row 2 is totally worth the $3.75 I paid during the Steam Xmas sale.If there is one thing I have learnt is that its awesome playing games 2 years after their release - Steam will flog it in a Xmas sale and the game will be just as great as it was at release.

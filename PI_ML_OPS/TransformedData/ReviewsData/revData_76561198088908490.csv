Even then, it's not ready for shipping. English is pretty terrible, too much extraneous fluff, and a total disconnected feel from your decisions.2.5/10 until really fixed"

I've playing for about two weeks, and if it's distracted me from modding Skyrim, then it's definitely something great. One of the aspects I appreciate most is the foundry: the freedom to create a DnD-esque questline and, eventually, campaign of your own! Granted, the game itself is awesome and a challenge* if you do it right!In other words: 8/8 m8*note: challenge does not account for everyone, it refers to the way I play."

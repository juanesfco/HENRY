I would defentily play it again if they removed these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay to win content. And yet, you really need to start making actual games rather than churing out billions of flappy bird play-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and yet it's getting depressing that you guys are still doing it.The combat is pretty bad with all these unesscary numbers and stuff along with ♥♥♥♥ as huge FX which it hinders the view of the game, thus making it diffcult to see.Besides that, the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing outdated to the point where it does not need to be revied. Is this the same as bring back your dead pet that has died without any problems, bringing it back will make it worse and suffer."

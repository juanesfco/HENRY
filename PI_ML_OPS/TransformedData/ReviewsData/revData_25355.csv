,"Posted February 4, 2014.","Last edited February 4, 2014.",221100,No ratings yet,True,"I'm recommending this game but only because I believe that it has potential. The game is borderline unplayable at the moment with nothing optimised, bland menu screens, and it just gives new players a really hard time. It's so hard to find decent weapons/loot at the start of the game and finding water .... don't get me started on finding water.It is still in alpha and I understand that. I just really think that, at the moment, you should buy this for when it comes out and not for the alpha. The finished game will be undoubtedly great!Like I said, I believe this game has potential, but I also believe that Rust easily rivals it at the moment.For the moment, I'm giving this game a 6/10 but only for how it is at the moment. I'm sure that will be bumped up to a 10/10 when it is finished (or at least out of alpha)."

,"Posted March 16, 2014.",,205910,No ratings yet,True,I remember playing the demo and having a lot of fun. Before i purchased the full version i had played the demo for 6 hours after i completed the game and exited to desktop i had played for 2 hours. However there is replay value. There's plenty of collectables and stuff to find but i really didn't want to do that. This game has been out for a while and after all this time i doubt there will be a sequel i'll admit i enjoyed my time with tiny & big and i do recommend it just don't think i'll return to it anytime soon. 6/10 - A stormy sky with no rain.. disappointing

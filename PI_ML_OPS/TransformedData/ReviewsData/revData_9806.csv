None of that matters. Excellent fun."

They are super tight and responsive. So many platform games could learn a thing or two from this game about good responsive controls."

,"Posted November 1, 2014.",,260230,No ratings yet,True,"Great simple game, that tells an excellent story.  Art style really suits the game and strikes the right balance between making the game enjoyable and showing the brutality of the war (especially towards the end). The narrative and historical facts you pick up during the game are a great addition and you will learn a few things about life in World War 1. The gameplay is quite basic, with puzzles being quite simple and can get quite repetative at times but are still enjoyable. My only criticism is that the 'skill' based action sequences can get quite annoying and you find yourself dieing a lot. You will find yourself passing them wth simply trial and error. Thankfully automatic save points are plentifull in this game. Would highly recommend."

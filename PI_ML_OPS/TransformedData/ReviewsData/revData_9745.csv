Sure it's one of the best Local Multiplayer games out there (one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had), but it's not worth it's price. I thought this game would have more content but it's definitely not worth it's base price $15, or $10, or barely even $5 for that matter. I expected the singleplayer mode to have way more in it and they should really mention that it's not worth it at all. It's definitely one of the most frustrating things I've played. It's more like a challenge mode, revealling bits of background story but it's just gameplay. If you get this game, you get it for the fun couch-deathmatches. That's the main purpose of this game. The trials and singleplayer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It should be replaced with a practice mode. And bring some friends and controlllers. Four of them. It's the only way to play multiplayer/properly. Keyboard sucks and eventually hurts after a while. I definitely DO NOT recommend unless it's on sale."

Oh I know! This game is a worthwhile purchase! Got it for 2 dollars during the Summer Sale and I'd say the 2 dollars is worth it, not sure about full price, but I think the game is worth the purchase!"

This game is so good at getting you psyched to play the next level because of the satisfaction of beating a stage. The game really brings out the 80s feeling and the ultraviolence into one magnificent package. Buy it now if you want to experience an adrenaline rush."

My god, I have missed out. This game is such a satisfying fighter, you feel so good after landing a 15+ hit combo and utterly destroying a team. The character designs and animations are gorgeous, they all look and feel different (unless we're talking about Filia and Fukua). Congratulations Skullgirls, you have a place in my favourite games of all time list."

,"Posted September 26, 2015.",Last edited March 10.,364690,4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful,False,SUPER DISTRO-REWIEW-Hardest Platform Game Ever!-This game is really bad in opinion because stages are too much hard because of bad stage designes-Controls are really bad you can just press move inputs and jump fire button and it's not enough to finish stages So if there would be any double jump button or auto health regen or like that something that would be better-Hardest Platform Game in my opinion and almost impossible to finish the game it's not fun!-So is it worth to buy it? Nope Exacly Nope..

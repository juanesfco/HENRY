This game has been on my HD for a pretty long time. Picked it up on steam sale, but never had the change/time to actually play it. I`m not into the 'beat him up' action games, but I am having a lot of fun with this 1! I thought I needed a controller. But Darksiders can be played easily with mouse & keyboard. Great action, great story-telling and great control!"

While not as story-driven as the first, it is still an enjoyable romp through the underwater hell known as Rapture. I haven't played the Minerva's Den DLC yet but I hear it is killer! 8/10"

I wasn't used to the old system of switching between plasmids and weapons and it took awhile to get used to. But after that, Boy was this the killer game of my childhood! It flows well, the story is killer and jumping on the PC instead of the console with the headphones on just made the game that much more immersive. This is a MUST-OWN title for any self-professed gamer and its essential to play through it, first time, without looking up spoilers. Would You Kindly buy this game and enjoy the HELL out of it! :P 10/10"

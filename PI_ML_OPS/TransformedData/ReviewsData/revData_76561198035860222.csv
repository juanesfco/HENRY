Physics are great, everything from serving to hitting just feels right to me, would recommend this to anyone and will be buying an extra copy to gift to a friend just to support the devs!IF YOU HAVE VR BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"

I love the customisation option for paddle up as well, i found it has a better UI to it and more in depth options. Overall i love both games but it seems to me at the moment Paddle Up definitely has me more excited to play it over Pong Waves VR."

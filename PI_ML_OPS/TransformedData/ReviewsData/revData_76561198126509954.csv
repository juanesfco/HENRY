Not even turning off the dynamic settings does anything. Not happy.EDITOk, so my last reviews for this game was negative, but now that I've made it playable, I'm quite happy with it."

Lastly, you can Spartan kick people in the gonads. This game is basicly Half Life 2 Deathmatch, only set in the wild west. If thats not cool, I don't know what is."

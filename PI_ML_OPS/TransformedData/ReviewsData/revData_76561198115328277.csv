The graphics arent the best but the gameplay is great. This game runs on any peice of crap which is great. This game also brings lots of nastolgia.

1 person found this review funny,Posted January 4.,,304050,No ratings yet,True,Game is fun at first but then when you reach the highest world for 1 character it gets boring. I saved enough for another character. Got that to highest world in atleast 20 minutes.At first this game is very fun and enjoyable but it gets too repetitive.

,"Posted April 7, 2015.",,270150,No ratings yet,True,"I bought this game straight up when I saw it a long, long time ago, and at first i was not sure whether or not i would enjoy it, or even if the Dev would run with the fans money with a half backed product.And i feel horrible for ever doubting, with literaly almost a thousand hours on game pre-steam and too many now, i must say I have spent far from enough time on it now.So to the meaty bits of this game,Pros:+Map design+Gun play+Team Work+AI that does not just herp a derp run infront of an MG+Range of weaponry+Vehicles+Online communityCons:-No VDV mod, yet"

At first this all seem's pretty straight forward so there is a slight grind at the start, but i didn't find myself bored of blowing up these funny little footbal player's!As you continue to earn cash to buy upgrade's or avatar's if you wish, although i would like to see more for online expression, every gamer takes pride in there charachter's but that last bit was entirly personal opinion :PBut the upgrade's seem quite a sufficient balance of defence and counter's and sometime's just have unbelievable resulst's!All in all , it's cheap it's a great laugh even if you don't get into the whole 'tatical side' of thing'sFor this im giving it (drumroll..)4 out 5 Duffman thrust's in your general DDDDIIIrectionnn!!!"

,"Posted April 6, 2014.",,4000,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,This is a very great game and i think the fun of this game is never going to end as they add more stuff more fun comes in place but if you want the full experience of this game you will need Counter strike:Source and other games that have stuff in it like Team Fortress 2 and CSS (Counter strike:Source) is mainly the only other thing you need but other wise the game is great

,"Posted January 15, 2015.",,209650,No ratings yet,True,"This game has succeeded in the call of duty series and over topped the last game Ghosts which was a major let down.  This game is highly detailed and will not let all first person shooter lovers down because it has loads of ways to customize, move and even fire a high tech direct energy weapon.  This is an amazing game that I highly recommend if you love FPS's"

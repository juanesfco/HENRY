Fret not, as I have a low-to-mid range pc and it runs beautifully. Amazingly fun, very addictive and would highly recommend it. Can't wait to see how it develops, as it is already a really top notch piece. Good luck to Ark devs, and may you all keep on surviving!"

They are avalible drom the start, as it features no unlocking feature for characters. Overall a brilliant game sutiable for everyone from 10+."

,"Posted February 22, 2014.",,220050,8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful,False,"I do not recommend this as the game is extremely simple. There is no challenge, no scares. The AI is woefully terrible, which I guess could be forgiven as they are zombies, however it just feels too easy on hard. I only played the first few levels, but the feel of the game just felt wrong. Like an unfinished game. There needs to be more fun rather than an endless stabbing zombies in the head simulator.If you are a fan of the series and want a Walking Dead experience then I would highly recommend you go and purchase the Telltale games series of The Walking Dead. They are brilliant pieces of storytelling that make you emote, and feel like you are actually making decisions that change the story. However if you wish for a FPS zombie shooting game then you should play something like the COD:Black Ops 1/2 Zombie mode."
,"Posted March 16, 2013.",,203160,No ratings yet,True,"This is one of the best games to come out in a long while. The graphics are amazing, the environments detailed, the characters are extremely detailed in both story and physically (they actually get damaged). Difficulty is a good balance. There are challenges that are harder to do for the OCD in us, or you can just rush through the story.Multiplayer is fine, if not more fun than the normal (possibly?) forced multiplayer for a singleplayer story focused adventure game. The only downside is a lack of community to play games with so you are lucky to get a game.The story is the most enjoyable in conjunction with the environment. They certainly have hit the ground running with the new Tomb Raider series."
,"Posted December 27, 2012.",,207610,No ratings yet,True,"This is one of the best games I have played. The story is compelling and the game mechanics are very interesting. There are many hard, impulse decisions to be made where there is no right or wrong answer."
,"Posted July 13, 2012.",,200010,No ratings yet,True,This is a very fun game. Some of the levels are quite hard too. If you liked Portal then this is a must buy!
,"Posted December 27, 2011.",,72850,No ratings yet,True,This is unbelievably good. Buy it now!
,"Posted July 9, 2011.",,620,No ratings yet,True,"This is an amazing game. If you haven't played then get it now, or if you haven't finished it then hurry up since the ending is awesomely funny."
,"Posted February 14, 2011.",,8500,No ratings yet,True,I highly recommend this game. It literally is like real life in it's amazing diversity of how to play the game. Definitely get the trial to check it out. I can give out 21 day trials (a week more than the normal) so give me a message. The best part is if you are good enough you can earn enough in game money to not pay for the game in real life money.
,"Posted December 28, 2010.",,70400,No ratings yet,True,"This is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long time. If you have a sense of humour, like JRPGs then this will surely make you laugh. Go on you know you can't resist."

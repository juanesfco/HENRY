A good selection of squad mates, I usually have a tough time deciding who to take. My only complaint is there's not enough missions. I really like the Fallout series, have played since the first one came out and this is a fine game. It's different that the rest, but it's fun!"

This is a good game, but the amount of 'nickle and dime' dlc is ridiculous. The full game now costs almost a couple hundred dollars. That is entirely too much for a video game to cost. Even waiting for a 75% sale the game in full is still $40, that's $40 for a game on sale for 75% off.  Also, trying to buy just one expansion and it's associated portraits, troops, and songs is stupid. Either you add all dlc and remove the ones (out of 50+ dlc) you don't want from the cart or back and forth adding one at a time. It's also not immediately clear which portraits, troops, and songs go with which expansion. Game is fine, but it's ruined with the dlc nonsense.One more thing, with every new expansion that comes out, it ruins your saved games. So even if you don't buy the expansion you have to start over anyways."

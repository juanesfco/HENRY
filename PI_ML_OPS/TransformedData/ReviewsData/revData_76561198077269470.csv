Nothing in this game requires you to pay to win, in other words although there are items you can buy with real money it remains a complete choice."

,Posted January 28.,,329440,No ratings yet,True,"I never thought I would be able to play this game because it was initially released on the Wii U, but now with the port I was quick to pick it up. Overall I really like this game with a few things that I thought need working on:- Sometimes when I go to change the input for the 'Run' button I cannot push any button I just have to restart and hope for the best- The 'Run' button- The changed controls for the 'Hover' Wisp (I dont know, maybe I'm doing something wrong)- The Snowball Act (Even though it is just one level)- and finally turning whilst using the 'Run' button as it seemed to slow down too much and felt very clunkyI'd rate this game a 7.5/10"

I would still give it a try though."

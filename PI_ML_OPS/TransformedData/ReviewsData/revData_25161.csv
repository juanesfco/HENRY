It emotionally affected me like no game ever has. The triumph of victory and the burden of defeat were ever present throughout. The unforgettable characters and 'hidden' story will forever be imprinted within my memory. It is not without its flaws, but from the experience that Dark Souls gave me i'd highly reccomened this game to anyone out there."

Its not too hard to learn how to play the game, it is hard to master. Its a time sink, where it always seems like you only over play on Dust 2. For me, personally, the game became saturated and dry very fast, finding myself doing the same thing over and over whilst wasting money on 'skins'"

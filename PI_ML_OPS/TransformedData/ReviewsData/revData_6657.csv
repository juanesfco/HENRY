,Posted June 2.,,292030,No ratings yet,True,"As soon as i heard this was coming out i was so excited just getting more hyped for it every day and everyone said you are going to be disapointed and i kinda thought they were right but im baffled by how entranced i am by this game the main story line was fantastic every single part of it was captivating and made me want more. The landscape and overall feel of the wilderness and cityscape was intense, each area had its own culture and Skellige                Novrigrad Vellen etc. etc. were completely different and the atmosfear felt so authentic.And the monsters i dont read much in games i just fly through it but they were so indepth the beastiaries were just a joy to read everytime i discovered another creature. Side quests Monster hunts and scavenger missions were well thought out and rich in story i felt accomplished after killing another Wyvern or Wraith and the spoils from them. Even the Monster Dungeons and Bandits camps were cool and different each time.IN SUMMARY everything about this game makes my heart flutter with joy and excitement this has been the best purchase ive made in a long time."

The game seems to be very good gameplay and all, but there have been alot of errors for me such as the mouse not operating. If Rockstar games could fix that error it would get better reviews and more people to buy it."

I was also influenced by how could win items for Team Fortress 2. Really gets peoples attention into playing it. 9.2/10 . Keep doing what your doing telltale games!"

I'm really glad to see that this game hasnt been abandoned as it really is a true Mythology game. I recommend this to all players who enjoy historical open world sandboxes."

,"Posted August 1, 2015.",,238210,No ratings yet,True,"The controls make you feel like a really fat, disabled old man, with no ears for a sense of balance, who may or may not be missing parts of his cerebrum and was born with ice skates for feet.Being a (somewhat) roleplaying game I took this opportunity to fulfil the quota of a backstory behind my character. Which is that he ended up on the space station when he took a wrong turn to the figure skating class one day."
,"Posted August 1, 2015.",,8870,No ratings yet,True,"I could tell you that this is a really well crafted game, with beatiful visuals. I could tell you how it was very well polished and rigorously playtested so that we get the best experience. I could tell you how Ken Levine outdid himself on creating a deep, thought-provoking story that gets you emotionally invested in its characters and how the ending will imprint an irreversable tattoo on your mind. I could tell you how it still holds up as one of the best games this decade and that you are a fool if you refuse to experience this.Or I could tell you that I spent an hour and a half screaming at my computer to work and promising it that I would upgrade it if it would just run the game, before flipping out and breaking my mouse.Take away whichever experience suits you best."

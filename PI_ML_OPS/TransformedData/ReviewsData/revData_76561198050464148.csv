Also the fact that there are 3 different classes all with different gameplay make for a long grind to get better weapons. Good use of vechiles though

It runs really badly on my computer with a 970, 16gb ram, 3.5ghz i5 procceser and the graphics look terrrible."
1 person found this review funny,"Posted July 19, 2015.",,219640,No ratings yet,False,I do not reccomend this game UNLESS you are buying it on sale for less than $10. Good things>customizable clothes and shields>fun gameplay mechanicsBad things>Terrible graphics>You have to buy in game hats with real life money. WTF?? I already i bought the game I don't want to pay for hats>You can buy in game weapons with real money. Unfair advantage>DLC is just a reskinned version of the orginal gameSo this game is not worth the full price. Only buy it if it is on sale.

It would be great if it had a server browser, sadly it seems to be progressing slowly and is demanding, even on the flat desert.havent played game to its fullest, but it is doing well. If you are really interested in the game, go right ahead and buy it. but if you are not sure about it, I wouldn't buy it just yet, keep an eye on it, look into it, learn what you can before you dive right in."

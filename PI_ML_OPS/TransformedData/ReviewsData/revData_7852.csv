,"Posted October 6, 2015.",,730,No ratings yet,True,So the ever famous Counter Strike. A somewhat good game. Infact im playing it now as i write this. If your new to the game then watch out. There are alot of good players in this and you will get rekt. Definetely not a game for those who are bad at FPS's. Invest at least 1 hundred hours if you want to get good. Thats it glhf.

A very fun game plus it is made by one of the original creators of Counter Strike!  So you know it is going to be good.  Also, free to play!  And no it is not a 'pay to win' game such as Combat arms.  So what are you doing?  You should be playing, right now!"

Plus steam workshop content adds a little fun twist to the game like new maps, weapons etc.. Totally worth the price you pay.  Highly recommend."

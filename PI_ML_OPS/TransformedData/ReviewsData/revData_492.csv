I was wrongThe graphics are visually pleasing and game has never crashed on me. The scavenging and random events system feels good. It has the right number of both events and items so to make neither annoying that you're required to make hundreds of choices or boring due to lack of action. The notes at the end of each day is a nice touch.Apart from the minor bugs, I don't have any serious complaints about this game. Strong recommendation"

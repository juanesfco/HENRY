,"Posted August 10, 2015.",,218620,No ratings yet,True,"Payday 2, where to start?Well first of all this game is a complete time killer. Personally I can sit here for hours on end robbing banks and going full blown stealth mode in art gallery. This game continues to excite me due to the fact that this game is part skill part teamwork as soloing a heist take skill, that is not the point of the game. Teamwork takes a massive role whilst playing this game espically on Death Wish difficulty missions. I find this game quite entertaining, as upgrading my weapons, skills and perks make my character quite a proffensional :) Overall this game is fun to play with friends and random's, but still continues entertain me :)"

Do you want a game where you can do anything you want, but with F.R.I.E.N.D.S.? Well GMOD is for you. With tones of workshop add ons, and amazing machinimas, this game is a great MP and SP experience."

This game is incredible from it's trading economy to competitive highlanders and even a game mode where you and your team verse a big strong man who goes by the name Saxton Hale. This game has absolutely everything. But don't forget it's amazing community with it's SFM animations and it's wacky Garry's Mod animations and thousands of pages of Fan Artwork. But did I mention the Hats? Yes, this name could infact go by the name Hat Simulator 2007. People go CRAZY for this special type of quality hat called an 'Unusual'. I unboxed my first yesterday and from a $2.49 Key, you get a $40 Hat. That is what strived me to write this rather long review for this Amazing Game. So, in the end, do I recommend it? HELL YES!"

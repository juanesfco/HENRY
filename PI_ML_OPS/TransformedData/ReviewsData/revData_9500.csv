Over a hundred heroes all free to play and to master, only use of money is cosmetics which has no actual effect on the gameplay itself, only giving the hero a unique look, this is my most played and favourite game and i dont see myself getting bored of it anytime soon. 10/10Edit: 2564 hours in still not bored"

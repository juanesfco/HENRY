There are many layers and details to consider, and I feel like there would be more to think about with each further playthrough. I've only just finished it and my mind is still reeling a bit, going over everything, connecting all the pieces, and thinking a bit beyond the visible aspects of the game. Just...wow."

Most of the time it's your own paranoia frightening you...Then you start to relax, only to find yourself being chased by a maniac. Tried to play it a second time, when the achievements became available, but somehow it's even worse when you know what's coming..."

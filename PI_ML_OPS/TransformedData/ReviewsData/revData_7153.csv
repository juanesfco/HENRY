A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however, buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods, it was a master piece.9.8/10TLDR - PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS IssueTip: Accompanied with right mods, it is a master piece"

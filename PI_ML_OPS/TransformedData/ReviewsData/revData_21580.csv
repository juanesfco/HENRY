,"Posted October 20, 2014.",,227940,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,"Heros and Generals is a really good game for anyone that is intersted in the war or fps games.The only downside is that most players will end up joining the Germans side making it a lot harder to find games. Good textures and sound effects, but has a few bugs and kinks but ither than that its a pretty good game.8/10"

Such as maybe making co-op? i mean a lone ranger vs 5-6 robots with few ammo in your inventory is pretty much death for you. So maybe having your assistant with you might make a huge difference. Also, if you took the hint, there is rarely any ammo to be found throughout the map at best, 1 in 4 houses has like a clip of revolver ammo. Food is abundant though. i do think this game has potential and i if there is future awesome updates.I would be up for it.  7/10"

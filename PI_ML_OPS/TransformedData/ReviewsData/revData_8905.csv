The missions so far are detailed and the environment is beautiful, it really everything you could want from a game that wears the label of GTA. It is the second GTA San Andreas, which is a game I love and one that has inspired my interest in technology & computing. Rockstar did a better job with the GTA 5 pc port than GTA IV. Rockstar learned their lesson well and produced something beautiful, I hope one day I can create something like GTA 5, something different but equally if not more beautiful. In summary this game is good and it would be a unlikely that rockstar would be able to push the wall any further even assuming computer power grows. Some elements could be added to the game but I feel that the choices made on the game where the right ones. I am not one to give 10 ratings but in the case of GTA 5 there are few improvements that could possibly be made to this game. 10/10"

But i really do hope you guys can somehow patch this up and i would re-install but, that would take forever when you have 245kbps download (Peak.) *sigh* but, nice game."

The last game (my opinion) was just plain boring, but these 4  'Dungeons and Dragons' fans did a FANTASTIC job on making the combat more fun in all the ways."

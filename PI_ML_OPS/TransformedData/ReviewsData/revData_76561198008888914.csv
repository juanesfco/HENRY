You have 3-4 different levels, but you do the same on each: Try to each the otherside whilst jousting your opponent. Great if you have a friend over and want to play a short 2-player game. Not really worth 15$ dollars, wait till it's on sale"

Usually WWII games are a bore to me, yet this was not the case for Sniper Elite v2. If you love seeing slow-mo cinematics of your enemies' heads exploding into pieces, this is a great game for you.'Fallout V.A.T.S. on steroids'"

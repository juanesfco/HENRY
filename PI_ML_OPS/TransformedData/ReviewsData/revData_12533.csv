Basic humans need food, water, oxygen and dota to live. Controlling your addiction is one thing. Curbing it is another. I never would recommend the latter. Taking away that one precious 1 hour of dota2 a week will make you suffocate. 2 weeks, and you will start to feel nauseous. In the 3rd week you'll start to develop 'finishing all homework' syndrome, which is not only bad, but contagious. Dota2 made my life better, but more so complete. I highly recommend Dota 2, Play dota 2 now and live a complete life lel."

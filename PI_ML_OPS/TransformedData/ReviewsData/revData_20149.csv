The community is extremely helpful and fast to reply to any question. I had a problem and with and hour I had a reply with a solution that worked. There are a lot of resources to get started making your game straight away. This is absolutely brilliant. If your kids want to grow up and be computer programmers than buy them this.My only wish is that the DLC/ extra exporters like the android exporter where cheaper. The IOS exporter is dearer than the main software (I guess that apple have something to do with that though, cough! cough!)."

Morrowind was revolutionary and oblivion captivating but this is so... So So. It is elderscrolls so its worth picking up when its on special under $10. The Hud annoys me it is clumsy and easily frustrating with the whole thing having a heavy consol feel. IMHO dont pay the full price but still there are worse games out there with higher pricetags."

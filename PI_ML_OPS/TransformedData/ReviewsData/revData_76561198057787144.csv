,"Posted March 19, 2014.",,72850,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best games I have ever played. Skyrim is a snowy and unforgiving place that has been struck by war. The Imperials and the Stormcloaks fight for the land and the freedom of Skyrim. Then there is You; A Prisoner (Like in all of the Elder Scrolls games) Captured by the Imperials and sentenced to death, and out of all of a sudden a dragon appears and attacks the local town you are in. The rest of the game is all up to you and your decisions."

Keep in mind what ever bugs you may encounter in the game will hopefully be patched soon and God help us if chucklefish deletes everyones worlds and characters again!

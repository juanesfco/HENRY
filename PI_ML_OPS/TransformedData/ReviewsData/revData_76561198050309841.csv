There is a huge amount of story, optional and side quests in this game and itâ€™s really impressive that they managed to make the vast majority of them, really interesting and rewarding. Witcher 3 does not compromise on quality or quantity. People may have talked about a graphics downgrade before release but once you look at the scale of the world and how much detail there really is, you will not be disappointed. The soundtrack adds and amazing layer of atmosphere to the game and builds up in the fights scenes. I highly recommend this game to everyone. For the price you get an insane amount of quality content, with more being added all the time. CD Projekt Red have created a masterpiece with Witcher 3, a game that every gamer should play."

,Posted March 3.,,427520,No ratings yet,True,"Can't speak highly enough. Only 10 hours in, near perfect experience so far. Only a fraction of the way through the mechanics, already heaps of replayability factor. Can see myself sinking a lot of time into this.This could easily be a full release, and after 4 years of development still more to come?Big ups Wube."

Esentially the same planet over and over again, even in systems 1.3 MILLION light years away.I am however, hoping there will be content updates that add building, base building ect.. Make the game.. less crap.I also just read on the website ' Every creature, geological formation, plant and spaceship is unique. '. This is by far the biggest lie i've ever seen for any game!Don't buy, not yet anyway, it's not worth the money, not even close."

,"Posted November 19, 2015.",,211820,No ratings yet,True,"So far I have only played 36 hours of starbound and I would certainly recommend this game.Pros:-Has quite a lot of features considering it is an early access game ( that might be because it is nearly out of early access)-(some people might think I am talking rubbish here) Has very little bugs-Has a very detailed character creation giving you the ability to customise your character to your likes-Music is also very nice-The interface is very easy to used to and after a while feels natural-(to expand on reason 1) you can upgrade your: Ship, Mater Manipulator (basically starter mining tool that can mine everything but slowly)- Every race a little back story to it- You can get special abilitiesCons:- Some quests are a bit ridiculous e.g. for one quest I travelled at least 3 solar systems trying to find a floran villageTo sum it up I think it is a pretty polished up game and it has a lot of content and will sell well."

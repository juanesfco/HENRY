Tomb Raider has been a game i've been playing ever since 2005, where I used to have no idea what to do and just run around and act stupid. But this Tomb Raider is jaw-droppingSome pros are: -Exploring is amazing-The characters storylines are outstanding-Roth is hella sexy-Character development on Lara is awesome!-Tombs are bossThis game is also not just for Tomb Raider fans, with a completely new storyline never seen before  characters, this game can be recommended to fans of action/adventure. 9/10"

No, seriously, I couldn't build units, helicopters, or anything other than structures. Game constantly glitched out and turned the map black,  and so many other things I can't even begin to type out. I want my money back, like I stated before."

I paid 6+ dollars for it and it was NOT worth it , because, NOWHERE in the label or description does it say it  does not run on windows 8. I will be requesting Steam for my money back, and if they will not return my money, I will be heading to the devolopers to complain to them. I'm sure it's good on windows 7, but those on windows 8, stay away!"

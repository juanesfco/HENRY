It had potential, but the developers just took the money and ran away. Now all we're left with is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, half-finished game that has potential, but will never live up to its full. Oh, and the nightly updates are just another way Chucklefish is trying to convince us it is working on this game, even though it seems to be moving at a snail's pace."

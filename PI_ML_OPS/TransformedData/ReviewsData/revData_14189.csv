I really loved the atmosphere and its dark puzzles and EVERYTHING! For 2 years and 1 guy, it shows a lot how a single developer can create a little fantastic game. I really recommand this little game.10/10 - AWESOME GAME!5/10 - Short but worth itWho knows, if Valve put this on Steam then it could be a hint there will be a HL3?? The game is called Transmissions: Element 120 and 120 has 3 numbers in it....HL3 CONFIRMED?? Or maybe they are starting to add the best HL mods? WHO KNOWS!?"

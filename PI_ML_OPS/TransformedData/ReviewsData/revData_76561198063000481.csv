Good graphics, smooth gameplay, alot of Pinoys playing on the oceana server which is annoying because it limits communication, good selection of hero's with all of them free unlike League of Legends and smite, but some hero's are very overpowered to the point where rage quitting happens.Overall i score this an 9/10"

,"Posted July 10, 2014.",,261030,No ratings yet,True,"Amazing story, you feel for characters. Good cartoon graphics. Episodes 4 & 5 coming soon. Definetley a story game, not much game to it. Worth a full price tag with all episodes."

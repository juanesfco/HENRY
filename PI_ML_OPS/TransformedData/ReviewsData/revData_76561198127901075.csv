If you don't think there's enough, just go to the WorkShop and download some add-ons. I have had so much fun in the past, there are so many different game modes to play which is what I love about it. Getting on the game every now-and-than and screwing around with your friends building the most stupid things."

It has the most amount of emotion and the graphics are phenomenol; I got stuck into the story so much, the combat is pretty amazing and I loved the parkour. Kinda disappointed that they abandoned the Multi-Player. Definitely would recommend this game."

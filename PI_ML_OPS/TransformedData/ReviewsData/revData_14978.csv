There's nothing on the market like it and I love running my ship.  This game even runs on my netbook that sports a 1.6ghz Atom processor and runs on Ubuntu Linux.  I've yet to beat the game but have spent countless times trying different ship configurations and you unlock more ships as you go.

,"Posted June 5, 2014.",,256330,9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful,True,This has to be one of my all time favourite racing games.  The cars are amazing.  The tracks are incredibly well designed and its great that competitors can't run you off the track in multiplayer.  The cars handle really well and there is just so much going for this great rally game.  The weather effects are really amazing and the graphics are great.

Took me a little while to work out the movement mechanics but it was a load of fun.  A little short but lots of fun.  I'm hoping they make more levels or some DLC.  Take my money. First 100% in a steam game on this.  I also loved the electro sound track.

But i love this game especially because of the weather, events, challenges, and i cant play it (because i have no friends) but there is a multiplayer mode as well, you can also create your own route for singleplayer, friends and global players, as well as play other peoples routes (obviously). you dont have to, but i like to play with a ps4 controller, as it makes things a lot easier. But overall i give this game an 8/10 (oh, and by the way, im not very good with spelling or grammer as i am only 15 years old)"

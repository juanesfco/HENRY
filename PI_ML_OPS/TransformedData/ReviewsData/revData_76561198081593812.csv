I wouldn't call it the most polished game, considering the single player aspect of it isn't the best, due to the friendly AI's inablility to do much, except shoot and move around. With friends or without, multiplayer gameplay is insanely addictive and amusing. However, stealth is a bit finicky, bugs are quite rampant, and the community can be quite undesirable."

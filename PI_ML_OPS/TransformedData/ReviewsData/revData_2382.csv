,"Posted December 15, 2013.",,440,No ratings yet,True,Has to be the only game in witch most of the memmory it takes is just hats... But also is one of the most fair and balanced games ever every class is useful and has a weakness there are thousands of guns that all have their different affects that you can find lots of different and fun gamemodes such and mann vs machine. As such this is the best multiplayer game to date.

Honestly, I cannot understand why I uninstalled it, BUT, I think it is an EXCELLENT game for any of you CALL OF DOOTZ fans, I should know. I played CoD alot, then I played this and I was amazed. Then again, not many people are fans of valve and CoD. It's understandable but my personal rating is...Well...20/10 ^-^ Brilliant game. Absolutely brilliant."

The random level generations, variety of characters and choice of guns makes every play through new and interesting. Difficult the game may be, it's still fun.Along with the addictive gameplay, the soundtrack is brilliant. It suits the situation of the level you are playing in."

Although the game lacks story, it compensates in the satisfaction of mastering the gameplay. Addictive gameplay and arcade-y feel is all over this game."

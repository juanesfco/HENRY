I can work with thisTime of dragons is fun as hell and the gameplay is like Dragon: the game and warthunder mashed together but there are just some thing I would like improved and in the game- a firstperson view- Make more better dragons cost more DNA- Make it so you can choose servers- Make more gamemodes- Make the guns take more shooting time before they overheat- Make it so your dragon can go on the groundBut it is a good game

,"Posted April 23, 2015.","Last edited August 22, 2015.",310790,No ratings yet,True,One of the reasons why I got this is because I liked retro-evolved but when I played it there was no retro-evolved like mode so I didn't play to much untill I heard the developers released an update saying that a retro-evolved mode was getting added so I started playing again and I say it was worth it.Also the developers should add a part where players can make their own levels and add it on workshop

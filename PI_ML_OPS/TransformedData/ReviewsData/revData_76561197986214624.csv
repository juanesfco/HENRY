Made all the more exciting when you play with a number of friends, its fast paced action and ripper soundtrack will have you and your mates saying “Come on… Just one more time”.  Pros: Game play is intuitive, making it easy to jump straight in and start playing. Great variety with 6 unique visually appealing levels“Gauntlet” mode for a whole extra degree of challenge Awesome soundtrack that really enhances the feel of the different levelsGreat “kid friendly” funCons:  Where did my afternoon just go……"

The remake with its imprpved graphics quality, using the renowned voice acting we have come to know, makes this a terrific game all over again.   It's release on the tablet market is likely to se  a resurgence of the point and click adventure game.  Monkey Island's witt, game play, story, music and charm make this game a 5/5 for me."

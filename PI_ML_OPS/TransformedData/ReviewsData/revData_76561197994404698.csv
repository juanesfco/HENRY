,"Posted June 15, 2013.",,218230,No ratings yet,True,A fps with a military feel to it.  A great game if you like using teamspeak or other game microphone comms.
,"Posted June 15, 2013.",,43160,No ratings yet,True,This game was the benchmark that converted me to like stealth games.   I have come to enjoy the stealth roll and have started to branch out into other stealth games due to playing this game.  I think everyone should play this game so their playstyles can evolve into the stealth playstyle.  Awsome graphics... great game.
,"Posted June 15, 2013.",,8870,No ratings yet,True,"Great visual scenarios (probably the best ever made so far), great achievement names, a few glitches that can be worked around. mind bending plot, loads of exciting conflicts.  A great game that kept me immersed."
,"Posted June 15, 2013.",,205100,No ratings yet,True,"Strategic FPS  with a main emphasis on stealth.  Each comflict requires thought for the best possible outcome, and you have to try and figure out the best way to survive.  Not all conflicts reqire a subtle approach, but to me the stealth aspect is a lot of fun.  Can save as many times as you want. It has limited slots for save game files though. I enjoyed it heaps."

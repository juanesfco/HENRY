It was on a mac then moved on to windows but was still fun. The physics is amazing and the creativity is endless. But there is a lack of addons and content in Blockland. luckly there is return to blockland (rtb) which you can download addons from the cumminity, manage friends etc. it would be much better if they added Return To Blockland as a DLC on something along those lines. I was excited that it had finally been added to steam. I  REALLY recomend this game I give it a 9.2/10. Also one more thing, I felt abit sad that the maps where removed :( I know some of them where pretty bad but not the ones such as the Bedroom or the kitchen they where pretty good maps. I wish for them to bring the maps back, now that would give me a 10/10!EDIT: ITS BEEN a month..where are the MAPS?"

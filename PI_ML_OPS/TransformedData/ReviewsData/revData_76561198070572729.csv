I go to play the game and its bugged and would black screen immediately. 5 hours of troubleshooting and choosing the repair option (which did nothing but waste time), at 2 in the morning i finally get this game going by adding some strings in the UserSettings.txt file which was originally missing when i installed. Game starts, nice cut-scene, first level doesnt load and im kicked for inactivity. Terribly done. Will never buy from zenimax again but i will keep trying to play the game and if i dont manage to, i will refund and buy a working game."

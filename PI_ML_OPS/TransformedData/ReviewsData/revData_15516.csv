I've never really been into speed running, but for some reason I really enjoy this.  I've gotten about 6 hours of gameplay out of the first strike alone, so personally, its already been well worth the price tag. Great gameplay, great graphics, great music, great style, and it even has hit markers. What more could you want? I rate it gr8/8 m8. Looking foward to what else they come up with."

Also, some creatures attacks should not always be an outright elimination of Aura (such as the boars attacks removing an improved Aura bar completely, when they do that normally). Apart from that, I can't think of many other improvements that you haven't thought of already (such as more levels and characters). So I will leave this review with the fact that this game is incredibly fun and entertaining, but it needs improvements, and I assume they will be made further down the line, and so would like to thank you for them. Hope this is helpful, and thank you for creating such an awesome game. 7/10"

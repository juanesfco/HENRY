,Posted July 3.,,292240,No ratings yet,True,This is a pretty good kids adventure game. Surprisingly complicated for one and actually contains multiple paths. Make sure you and your child have a high tolerance for puns.

There is not a great deal of art assets in the game, and there are only 2 characters that you are able to interact with, but it manages to tell a very moving tragedy of the final years of a  colony ship."

,"Posted December 2, 2011.","Last edited November 25, 2013.",72850,No ratings yet,True,This game is amazingly open and fun. It has managed to absorb my time in a way that I had definitely not expected. I ended pushing toward the end primarily to reduce my own need to play the game so I could play others. I really look forward to more content being released for it.

When I really get in the groove it is great to zoom past buildings getting close without hitting them. The game revels in its own strange world. If you don't already own this, I suggest getting AaAaAA for the Awesome, which contains this game, more levels and VR support."

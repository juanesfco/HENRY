,"Posted May 6, 2015.",,232090,No ratings yet,True,Killing floor 2 is a welcomed upgrade to the original killing floor. The skill trees add some extra benefits to each class and the maps have huge detail put into them especially biotic labs. The graphics are another leap forward and im really enjoying every minute so far. Id recommend for those aiming to loose some time in their night and spank some zombies all around. Whilst the maps are currently limited im sure with release it'll be overflowing with maps.

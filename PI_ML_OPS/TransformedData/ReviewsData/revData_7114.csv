I enjoy playing this with friends. Garry's mod comes with heaps of gamemodes in store like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dark Roleplay, Death Run and Much much more. This game at the moment is $2.49 (when this was posted) the best price for any game. I suggest you buy this game."

The game is really worth the $15 USD. If you are a fan of 1.6 or Source I have a big thought in my mind that you will enjoi Counter Strike : Global Offensive."

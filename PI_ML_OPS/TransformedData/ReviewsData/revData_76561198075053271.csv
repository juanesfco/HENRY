,"Posted February 28, 2015.",,313120,No ratings yet,True,"Great game! Would recommend to any people who love survival/horror games like the forest. Here are some key points that I love and hate.Pros:-The game looks great on ultra-Islands are loaded with useful items such as: Palm Trees, Yucca plants (which produce lashings, also known as rope) and more.-Sharks are bloody aggressive since hot fix 0.02.-Ship wrecks are awesome.-Quite realistic.Cons:-As it is in the Pre-Alpha stages (obviously) it lacks content. Even though it is an infinite world, there is only a handful of items avaliable to the players.-Glitches galore!Great game in general though."

The messy kills you can do, how realistic it looks, and the quests are fun to do. I like how you sometimes encounter battles while you are traveling, also. Gives you a chance to get some extra experience and some extra loot. I love this game and I recommend this game. 100/10"

So here is my 'more than a review'...Life is Strange, you have made my emotions go in so many different ways. You have made me question so many things in life on a daily basis. You have made me think hard. You have made me be more aware. But more importantly, you opened my eyes. You opened my eyes to the world and its realities. You have opened my eyes to what the world really has in store for us. Life is Strange, you made me see that things need to be payed attention to. But most important of all... You have made me open up to the fact that long lost friends can be the key to your life. You are the best thing I have ever had the pleasure of playing. From butterflies in bathrooms, to being trapped in an unimaginable situation. From being bullied to being a hero."

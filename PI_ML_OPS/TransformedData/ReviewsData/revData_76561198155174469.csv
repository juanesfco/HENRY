Unlock achievements and create massive bases, drive vehicles and, most of all, SURVIVE!!! A great family game and survival for the smartest and strongest only, many places to investigate and raid. Not too much blood and gore for those who are faint at heart. This game is reccomended to anyone preparing for the apocalypse!!! :D"

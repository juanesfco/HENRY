The ambiance, the unique gameplay mechanics and the amount of effort put into this.And like every game this one also has flaws, but they dont make it unplayable, like the sprinting being a bit slow but nothing much special. Even though the game may not look scary, trust me, it is. You need to be alert at every little sound in the game so that you don't die, the tension when you can't find what is causing the sound gets you desperate, but the more you adapt, the easier it gets.This game gets 9/10, cause yes :3Have fun playing it, you won't regret it."

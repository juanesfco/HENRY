As soon I booted it up again after 14 years I still get the nostalgic feeling when I hear the intro. It's just one of those games I would put so many hours into and still wouldn't get bored of it. It's definitely a must buy if you have never played GTA III before. Same goes for Vice City and San Andreas. Those three are forever the greatest of all time.

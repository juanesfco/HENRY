,"Posted May 28, 2014.",,208090,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,False," with the recent series of issues like connection errors, poorly balanced weapon parts and the game  crashing randonmly plaguing loadout, it is now clear that the game was nowhere near ready for release and could've benefitted from a longer and more extensive beta test; which would've allowed for all of the game's features to be fully added and optimised.adding onto this, the developers could communicate more with the community about any critical events like region shutdowns rather than just spontaneously shutting the regions down without informing the community and suffer from subsequent backlash.All in all, avoid this disastrous mess until they're resolved.(also, I couldn't save this as an edit to my  previous review)"

,"Posted June 11, 2014.",,8930,No ratings yet,True,An immersive and thoroughly enjoyanble strategy experience that pits you as the leader of an entire civilization who is responsible for its ascension to both power and victory (which can be achieved through several means).
,"Posted May 4, 2014.",,6000,No ratings yet,True,"despite it's age and how short the campaign is, republic commando is a game that is definitely worth playing as it puts you through the perspective of a clone commando and how they deal with the war and their perspective on it.In addition, you are able to command an elite squad of clone commandoes and issue them orders to overcome the enemy through superior tactics."

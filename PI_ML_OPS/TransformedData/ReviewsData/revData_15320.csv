Requiring good communication, strong game sense and excellent control of weapon recoil and spray control, Counter-Strike : Global Offensive is a fun yet challenging experience!"

Features that I enjoyed were the wall hacks or HRV, customizable characters and guns and also big, heavy mechanized hardsuits or 'mechs' which make this game a lot more fun."

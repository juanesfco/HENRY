Fnaf3 is packed full of challenges and hidden secretes, but this does not take away from the story or corrupt it. i like the feature of the devices failing and the hallucinations are awesome! People think these games are a one scare game you buy and leave, but it isn't because of fascinating story about the children murders and the fun and unique game devices. i rate the new installment 9,5/10. I only wish that sometimes your deaths are cheated.      CANT WAIT FOR FNAF4!"

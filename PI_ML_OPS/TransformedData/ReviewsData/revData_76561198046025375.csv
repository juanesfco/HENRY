I'll thell you a story there i was floating in a glorious nebula (looking at the wonderful site) and then i move on sector, i'm the boarded by robots which then proceed to kill mot of my crew members (leaving 2 out of 5 alive), they then go and destroy my oxygen system thus suffocating the rest of my crew.you will die quite a lot, but it is amazing.100/10"

,"Posted May 17, 2014.",,570,No ratings yet,True,"This an amazing game, but can be very stressful at times. When you start to play this game it is very difficult but after the first 20 hours or so, you start to get better at the game and you might even continue playing it for many more hours. The graphic quality is beautiful, gameplay is smooth.The only down side i can think of is it is a damanding game, but  other than that over all amazing, it is worth downloading."

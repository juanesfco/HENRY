Just to confirm this is a shooter not a horror game except for that there is a large amount of bugs, on a postive not it can be fun... sometimes"

,"Posted December 24, 2015.",,730,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,This once simple and fun game has gone proffesional and is now more suited to hardcore gamers as majority of it's fanbase focous on trading and betting. Such a shame as Counter Strike used to be good. If you are either have a talent at moving your mouse fast or are extremely competitive this game is for you.

I generally don't choose the latter. This game has a great intro and backstory with lots of new things appearing through out the game. Great buy for a sandbox and reform loving gamer!
,"Posted December 18, 2014.","Last edited December 26, 2015.",203140,No ratings yet,True,Great story line and immersive campaign. Great purchase for stealth gamers as there are many ways to take out targets. The game is aimed to be for offline use but the makers tried to make it online but in doing so the game became cheap and plasticy rather than the solid offline experience they wanted. Good buy!

,"Posted July 10, 2015.",,333930,No ratings yet,True,"great game, regardless the fact that its still beta (with forgivable glitches). the best thing about this is it is one of those few games that arent pay 2 win, and you dont need a tryhard computer to actually enjoy it. its a concoction of the teamwork of tf2 with the gunplay of cod, although i would recommend the devs to add more guns for one merc and a customization option"

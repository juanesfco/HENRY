The gameplay itself is very fun and engaging, and the puzzles are quite challenging but without being too hard. Overall it's an amazing game. It's worth $10 but you can currently get it from the Humble Bundle for $1+."

If you like platformers, you will like Garrys Mod. If you like physics games, you will like Garry's Mod. If you like shooters, you will like Garry's Mod."

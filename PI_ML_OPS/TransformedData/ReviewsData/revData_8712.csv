Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays. The most complete Motorcross game available. progressive career, lots of bike upgrades and gear options. I have played EVERY motorcross game since excitebike on nintendo. This is a solid MX game 8/10"

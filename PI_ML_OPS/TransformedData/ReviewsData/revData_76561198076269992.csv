You won't regret a single bit you spent on buying this game. Loads of content in this game. Many side quests, story missions are great, lots of interesting DLCs and there is also True Vault Hunter Mode! What are you waiting for? Just get the game now! I have enjoyed this game a lot and hopefully will be getting the DLCs soon. Hope all of you will enjoy this game as much as i did!"

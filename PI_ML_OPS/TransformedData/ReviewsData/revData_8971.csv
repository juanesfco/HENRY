As an RPG game lover, I love the elements implemented into it with a mixture of Pokemon (more like the sense of Pokemon). Its soundtrack is great, its story is expandable to three different endings, and it will fill you DETERMINATION."

I reccomend this game for gamers the love challenges and also have an amazing sense of humor. This is the most-liked gamed on Steam, and if dare try to find a bad review, you should go home and rethink your life. P.S. - You will find a 'ball of iron and a vegetable.'"

I have got many hours out of this game and will get many more, if your a creative person or like planes BUY THIS GAME :D"

This seems like an interesting game to learn to speedrun, there are some tricky sections and tricks. I absolutely reccomend this game for a thoroughly  entertaining 2-3 hours."

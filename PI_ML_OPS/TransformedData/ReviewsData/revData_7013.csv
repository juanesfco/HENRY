The game may be old, but it packs one hell of a fun train. You'll go through the traditional learning stage, and they you will get to the point where you'll be like, 'Im good at this game!' Its an easy to learn, hard to master type of game, and I like that. I encourage anyone interested in getting Cs:go, to pay the $10 or so dollars, and give it a try. Chances are, you will enjoy it. I hope you found my review helpful. -RoyalNemo"

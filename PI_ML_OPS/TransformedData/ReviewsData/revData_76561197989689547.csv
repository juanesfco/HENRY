The developers take pretty much a lot of their ideas from that and put it here ... except they haven't catered it properly here. They even use 80% of the same skills like 'Flair, Vision, Bravery'... LOL Basically this is like me watching Masterchef or some cooking TV show and me trying to replicate all the methods ... to build a sandcastle."

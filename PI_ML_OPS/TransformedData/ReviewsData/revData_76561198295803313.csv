I've never played such an entriging game like CSGO and don't plan to stop. This game is one heck of a ride and i'm sure you'll get better as you keep playing. Even if you don't like these games, you should still get that game, as it is very popular and you will have a thrill of a lifetime! P-S : The skins in this game can blow your money, so just be careful with what your spending. :P"

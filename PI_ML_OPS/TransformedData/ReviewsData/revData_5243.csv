,"Posted October 15, 2015.",,218620,8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful,False,"With over a thousand hours, and most of the DLCs, I would have wholeheartedly recommended this game to anyone.However with the release of Crimefest 2015, Overkill now has broken all modding, and added paid weapon skins that improve your weapon's stats. I cannot in good conscience recommend such a game.Hell, even the 'Overkill Approved' Hoxhud mod has been disabled."

It was fun at the start, also competitive with stupid silvers (no offense to those silvers who are new im also silver 1 but with big ♥♥♥ stats). Let me talk about competitive5v5 IS INTENSE! I LOVE IT. YET PEOPLE IN SILVERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOPERATE.WHY I'M STILL SILVER 1 FOR 2 MONTHS? OH CMON I KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME ALL DAY."

It's free. It's like DayZ, mixed with LFD2, mixed with Minecraft.I look forward to the future of this game a lot."

With the amount of fun and action this brings you, you'll be consumed and keep coming back for more. With many game modes, maps, weapons and classes, this game is better than most FPS or fighting games I've played. Well done, Torn Banner, well done indeed."

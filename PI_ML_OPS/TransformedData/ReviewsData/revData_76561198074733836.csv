Also, the custom campaigns from the workshop add a boost of entertaining and the scavenge on the rooftop from No Mercy map is very awesome. The plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way. I spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it, that's why i highly suggest everyone who's interested in good content should try this.It has its ups and downs. You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.In conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!"

Sometimes becomes repetitive when you begin a new world, but a lot of fun with friends! Also, the fact that is very hard to survive the winter season even with the thermal stone in your inventory (which decreases its temperature fast) and the deerclops attacking you make this game challenging!"

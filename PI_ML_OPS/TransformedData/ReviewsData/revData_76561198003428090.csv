,"Posted July 21, 2015.",,250900,No ratings yet,True,"I was enamoured by the original Isaac, the quirky artstyle, glorious dark humor, unique and complex gameplay and a level of content that was absolutely ruinous to my productivity. But it had its downsides, it was buggy, locked at 30 FPS and somtimes left you cheated or wanting more.Rebirth is Isaac, polished, fixed, and multiplied. It's an addiction.I've lost most of my friends, my job, dropped out of uni and forgot to eat and shower for who knows how long, but it was all worth it.10/10 would thoroughly recommend.Even though the upcoming expansion may actually kill me."
,"Posted July 4, 2015.",,257510,No ratings yet,True,"Croteam's 'Easter Egg Hunting With Some Puzzles As Well' is a great game about pretending to do some puzzles and then investigating every nook and cranny of every level to find the various tasty easter eggs hidden within.Graphics (lighting especially) is great as usual from Croteam, fluid movement and simple puzzles that can sometimes be fairly challenging are also par for the course.A decent storyline with a fairly hefty amount of lore in the form of various terminal based text logs is intriguing enough to make you lust for more.20/10 ♥♥♥♥ game"

Not as good as the more popular games such as left 4 dead 2, but it serves well for those who wants to play a similar game but can't afford it. Great game, loads of blood. loads of fun. 7/10. :)"
,"Posted January 13, 2014.",,440,No ratings yet,True,Essential to anyone who owns steam. It takes a while to download but it's worth it. So many differnt options. A great comical fps that deserves a solid 8/10. Storyline isn't obvious but the great this is discovering the origins of the Characters.
,"Posted January 13, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,Great sandbox. Just for messing around and the gamemodes are addicting. I give it a 8/10. It just lacks story. (There is none) but we can cut it some slack just because it's a sandbox game.

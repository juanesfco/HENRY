I guess what I like most about this is its not like most strategy games where the AI mechanics eventually just 'give up' and stop doing anything productive at the end-game, they will constantly produce content for you to enjoy for hours on end... also not to mention workshop integration for community made historical battles and events to scale maps of earths countries and continents, if you are a turn based strategy fan or not (I wasn't), this is a franchise you MUST try."

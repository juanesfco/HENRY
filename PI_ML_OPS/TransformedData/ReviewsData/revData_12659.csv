And its only getting better, being in early access. From every detail to detail in this game, it is well executed. From the open story style, to the creative and balanced weapons.It's a nice, fresh new look at scifi topdown racers. I would compare it to micro machines, in SPACE! But yeah, it's great. You will enjoy it for a very long time."

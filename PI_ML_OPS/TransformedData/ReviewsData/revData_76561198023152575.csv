Let’s Start at the model... it looks excellent, I dig the matching White coat and red shirt but It’s quite different from what we've expected from the trailer compare to the in game model… Well his bald, I’m not saying that I hate or anything but still… No hair… trailer got hair… in game sparkly head… Speaking of Sparkly… I was expecting that Jiro do some silly Engrish but no said Overkill I want my Jiro to do full Japanese on this ♥♥♥♥ even in pager response... Instead of a Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa like voice from the trailer his voice sounded more like the Japanese commercial of Mr. Sparkle from the Simpsons...The Micro Uzi isn’t much of a help though since we already got like 3 Uzi versions (Mac 10, Classic Uzi and Jacket's piece) poor accuracy and ammo but got great advantage of concealment... they should have added it from the game ages ago and place it with much more worthy gun...Overall if you want to buy the DLC just for the Katana and by all means go aheadAlready got 4 Cloaker heads on my fire placeJust got back from a game and just sliced a Cloaker in half"

,"Posted October 25, 2014.",,218620,2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful,False,Look this game is no where near the requirements it sais it needs. It is terribly optimised and was no where near the specs I could play. I dont recommend it the gameplay is good. But I can't run it cos they ♥♥♥♥en lied to me.

,"Posted September 26, 2014.",,264140,No ratings yet,False,"Honestly I have barely anytime on this game because after recruiting about 6 pirates i got bored. Its setup to have the same thing everywhere, its not interesting like its previous games terraria and starbound, there are many bugs and there is no base story and nothing to do. Just beat 4 bosses its so godamn boring that i cried knowing i spent $10 on this terrible game. People get off this page and find a better $10 game example Killing Floor or Garry's Mod something actually bareable"

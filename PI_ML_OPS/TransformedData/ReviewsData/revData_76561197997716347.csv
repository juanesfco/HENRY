,"Posted January 25, 2015.",,248860,No ratings yet,True,"This game brings me back.  Way back.  Way back to my 386/33+Boca graphics, playing deep into the night.  It's similar to the late 80's and early 90's quasi rpg, exploration games.  Kinda like Fallout, Wasteland, etc. This one is perma-death and quite fun."
,"Posted January 2, 2015.",,262790,No ratings yet,False,"ODP is fun... at first.   My issues with it are:1.  Targetting seems random.  With no controller support, you use the arrow keys to shoot.  Shots go everywhere.  Shooting right, the shot can go up to 25 degrees off course.  This can be very frustrating.2.  It's perma-death.  That in itself wouldn't be an issue if the game wasn't tough.  Compounded with issue #1 above.3. There is no item reference, or log when you're in-game.  When you grab an item the description flies by way too fast.  I still don't know what the eraser does!YMMV but I find this game to be more annoying then fun.  It would be a few really easy fixes (and maybe a few harder ones... controller support would be good), but as it is now, I doubt I'll play it again."

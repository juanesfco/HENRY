The couple of units that are resued for this release recieved new skins, fitting the bestial natureof the race. Furthermore The new units look amazing, are a blast to use, and have a unique feeling to them. I would wholley recomend this to anyone who enjoys horde gameplay, or who wants to experiance Total War in a new way. On the matter of price, The extra cost is worth it, especially when a trip to the movies for myself and my GF would cost at least twice as much for a much shorther experiance."

While surviving you have to be mindful of yourself and your team mates (if you're a team player). Being a survivor with a killer as Wraith becomes a spine chilling, idontwannamoveanywhere experience as the eerie bell is rung. Killers can be op compared to survivors which makes escaping more than a run in the park- Overall a great game IMO despite small flaws as lobby joining, dcers and matchmaking. Overall 8/10 would die again"

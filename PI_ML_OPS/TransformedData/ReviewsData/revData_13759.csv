Not worth $1.00, espicially not worth $10 for something a highschool teacher made since he had nothing better to do. Once launching in, firstly only 3 other players were online and did not act very nicely towards me. Secondly, even though it does say it's an early access game, its still in pre-alpha. Not even alpha, *PRE*TLDR; Spent $1.00 on a highschool project that is meant to be in 48 hour game jam for ~FREE~"

If your looking for a game to show off your skill and power this is the place."

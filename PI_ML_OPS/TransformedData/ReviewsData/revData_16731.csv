That won't be possible here.On top of that bethesda and steam think they are owed a 75% cut for what may include none of their original assets. Think again.
,"Posted January 22, 2015.",,9480,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,Best of the series in my opinion. People used to the newer versions might have trouble adapting to the dated graphics and it seems to run at 1.5 speed on PC. Otherwise it's definatly worth playing.

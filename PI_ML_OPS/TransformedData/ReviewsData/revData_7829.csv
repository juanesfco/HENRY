Longshots and headers dominate in this edition, with possession-based tactics falling by the wearside to be replaced by route-one and direct stuff. The match engine is ridiculously inaccurate, and keepers are as good as an u12 sunday league keeper. Wish I never spent full retail price on FM15, hopefully patches balance it out"

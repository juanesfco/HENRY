Does a good mix of old and new things that keep it familiar yet entertaining. Character progression has lots of diffferent options with talent trees and lots of different gear and gem collection / socketing etc.Developers are great and have continued to improve the game throughout early access with the promise of continuing improvement in the future.Looking forward to sinking more hours into the full release!

,"Posted December 26, 2014.",,218060,No ratings yet,True,runner 2 is a very rare game to come across. When i Downloaded this and got in the game I was greeted with a good intro. (i got the 2 dlc pack aswell) & as soon as i went to start the first level i was fulfilled with a great desighned 2d platformer that has so much great things to it like the graphics for example. When i started running i was fulfilled with a great tune of music to my ears. (thnx to the turtlebeach headphones 4 xmas!)& even though i died a bit..i didnt mind and i was sort of happy to relisten that wonderful tuneso what im saying is if you are looking for a platformer or music game get this its great!

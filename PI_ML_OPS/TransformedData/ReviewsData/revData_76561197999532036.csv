,"Posted April 3, 2015.",,230190,0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful,False,"main issue I found was the game crashes to desktop every single time I start it, with no sign of being able to fix this issue, as it stands I literally can't play this game, verifying does nothing, reinstalling does nothing, and there's no mention of this issue on their site from what I can see. Besides a single thread of theirs saying they 'fixed' the issue. I would not reccomend getting this game until it's gone through some serious bug fixes"

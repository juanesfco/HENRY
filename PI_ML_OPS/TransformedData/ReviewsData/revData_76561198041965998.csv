,"Posted November 9, 2015.",,311210,No ratings yet,True,"This game isn't as bad as I was expecting. Keep in mind the last COD game I played was Black Ops 2. This game is fun to muck around with it's cheaper price at the moment I believe it's worth it. So far I've only tried MP and Zombies so i cannot give a review of the story, I don't expect much however.Let's start with the Cons:HUGE FRAME RATE ISSUES - Seriously fix this asap! The lag kills.Latency issues - A few times I think I've been placed on servers that aren't from my regionKillstreaks aren't new - All the killstreaks are basically reskinned from olders, not much new content hereAuto Shotguns - (Do I need to explain this further?)Controls were difficult to change - Issues with sliding and crouching after changing controlsPros:Multiplayer actually feels fresh - (From when I last played atleast)Lots of customization - Guns are customizable, skins, attachments, characters and so on.Jetpack and wall running - Need I say more? Who doesn't love a firefight whilst sprinting along a wall?Zombies looks crazy - I've played a tiny amount, but it seems like there is so much content here.I recommend this game if you're looking for some fun, either alone or with friends. I also advise you to buy it when it's cheap."

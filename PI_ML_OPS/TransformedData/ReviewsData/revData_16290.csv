However if you watched Adventure Time and you love the show, then its a pretty good game, and I think $20 is an okay price. Overall I give it 7/10."

Overall it is a very tasty cake and even if you don't have any icing on top it still tastes quiet nice, but it just wouldn't be the same without it."

,"Posted August 10, 2012.",,10180,No ratings yet,True,"To be honest its a good game and all, especially the co-op mode but the online SUCKS because there are hardly anyone who play this game any more. :( Therefore my verdict is get MW3 its a ctrl-c and ctrl-v version of MV2 and there are actually people playing it online."
,"Posted August 10, 2012.",,220,No ratings yet,True,"A master piece of gaming almost as good as art but with headcrabs, zombies, gravity guns, facist aliens and a good old crowbar."
,"Posted August 10, 2012.",,1250,No ratings yet,True,"Its scary, frightening, gory certainly not suitable with people that suffers heart conditions, children under 12 or people who get easily offended and cant quit ♥♥♥♥♥in about it. But its hell of a lot of fun and everyone who is sick of L4D2 should try it (since left for dead dosent have slow motion headshots but this does :D) enjoy!"

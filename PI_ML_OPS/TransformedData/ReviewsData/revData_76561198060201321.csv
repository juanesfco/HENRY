,"Posted January 6, 2014.",,730,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,Unlike the Previous Counter strike Games this One Has More flavour added into it therefore making it a lot funner and less boring. The Maps are a lot more detailed and designed making you feel like your in a real place not just some boring map with a few crates and 1 texture. The Tactics are very well done. Not like call of duty where you can just run out shooting and get shot multiple times and not die. If you do that on this game then may as well rage quit before thinking of buying this game. Graphics are very good considering this is a source game.Buy It. Its Worth it!

,"Posted October 6, 2013.",,242860,No ratings yet,True,"Very Fun Game! Best WW1 games out there, The Sounds are great Quality as well as the game graphics. The Animations are very well made like the reloading, the muzzles, the explosions etc. Being in those Trenches gives you that Immersive feeling which can at some points make you go 'Oh Sh*t, Get DOWN' while in most other war games can't Portray that Feeling. It just seems so real. I recommend you buy this game Definently!"

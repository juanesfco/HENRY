In the normal game mode, you spawn in with some bandages, a flare, a few other fairly handy tools and one objective: Survive. Buildings and cars around are deserted and you feel very alone. First thing you do: Look for items. This can range from weapons and tools to food and drinks. The game offers many different challenges and allows you to craft much needed items with the right ingredients. This game is much more fun to play with multiple people (and a microphone) because communication is the key to survive."

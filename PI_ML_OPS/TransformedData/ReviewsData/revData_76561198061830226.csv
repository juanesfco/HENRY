I don't care for graphics/eye candy as much as some others might, furthermore it may still be the best in the elder scrolls series! I Highly Recommend this game to anyone who is considering buying it or has enjoyed any number of the elder scrolls series. If you want some 'fancier' graphics than I recommend using the Morrowind OverHaul Mod, it improves the graphics, fixes a bunch of bugs while adding a couple of convenient mechanics and making the animations of walking/running much better than they were before."

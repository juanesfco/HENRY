,"Posted September 3, 2014.",,4000,No ratings yet,True,10/10 Wish I could go higher great game for you and your friends. Great game to find friends to play online with. Great game for pretty much everything I think I have round 800 or so hours so take that as you may. But definitely worth the money $10 seems like a rip off to valve actually.

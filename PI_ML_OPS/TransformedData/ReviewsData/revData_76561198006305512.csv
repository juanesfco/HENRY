,Posted August 20.,,242050,No ratings yet,False,The controls for this game are absolute ♥♥♥♥ing trash. Want to jump off a building whilst trying to climb? yea. Want to repeatedly die because 'let go of the wheel' is the same keyboard bind as 'slow down' ? Yea. Want to repeatedly pull out weapons and shoot the objective accidentally? yea. great game bar the ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious control ports.

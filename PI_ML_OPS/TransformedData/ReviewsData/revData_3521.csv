,"Posted December 3, 2013.",,12900,No ratings yet,True,"Wonderful game for a dirt cheap price. It incorporates music into the game very well, and not to mention, very addicting. It's really cool how the level is generated based on the music that you supply. If you're a producer, this game will make you listen to your music in a way that you previously could not.Verdict: I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who has a taste for music. 10/10"

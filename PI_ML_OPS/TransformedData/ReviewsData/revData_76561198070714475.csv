If you're coming off from other fps games such as CoD you'll need to completely adjust your playstyle ://. Interesting and difficult to handle mechanics involved, a must play for anyone who enjoys fps games :DD."

With a reasonable storyline and nice gameplay, this game definitely earns itself the position of one of the funnest and enjoyable strategy games out there."

A lot more action based yet still maintaining a lot of the creative aspects we know and love about Minecraft. If you don't mind the 2D layout, you should definitely give Terraria a try as it won't fail to disappoint, guaranteed :D"

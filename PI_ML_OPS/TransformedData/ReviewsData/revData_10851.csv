The voice acting is terrible. The story isnt brilliant. Know what you are getting into before you buy. You will need multiple save files, and to save at each stage of a mission in a new file.However, the gameplay is good and fun. I have played Sw 1 and 3. Therefore i know roughly what is going on. If you are presistent, and enjoy this type of game it is worth your time, knowing the above."

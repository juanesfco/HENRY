Too much recoil in the guns, going back to Call Of Duty, P90 is overpowered Blizzard Entertainment please nerf the AWP to make it a lag shot didn't even need to look at the enemy to scare him to death with your big gun kill and remove Dirty 2 from your list of games. 8/8 would unbuy this game and buy again or unbuy and use the $15 dollars to get a Burger at UBurger or something. A real life burger is worth more than a virtual burger."

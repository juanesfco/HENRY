The game itself is not problem, it's the launcher that can't seem to do anything without getting an error. I reinstalled three times to no avail and it has become frustrating. I would love to recommend this game but until Zenimax get their act together and solve these launcher issues (that have been plaguing users since release) I won't be doing that."

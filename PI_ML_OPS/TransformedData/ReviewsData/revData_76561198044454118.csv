It's $3, just deal with itIt's just too much of a tease. There is some amazing art direction and pixel graphics, the music is on point, the voice acting is okay (the police chief is a bit David Hayter), but the whole thing is just a polished vessle for a story, and that story just failed to satisfy my interest.I was so into the opening, the very original use of establishing shots and the pace was lovely, but then the game reaches a climax and just ends.*SPOILERS*There was a glitched-out post-credits sequence I got which revisited the game's environments, before remixing the final conversation with the droid, but this just raised more questions. I thought perhaps more would be revealed through successive playthroughs, but it was the same.Ultimatly, the game left me with the feeling that the designer/writer had a vision for a setting and a setup, but didn't have a strong enough statement to make, and thus the final product came off as a bit wishy-washy and vague."

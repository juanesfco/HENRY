,"Posted October 7, 2015.",,278360,No ratings yet,True,"ever felt a game so perfect in every single way that u just want everyone to know about it?this is one of those games, the atmosphere , the voice actors , the story , the art design , the mechanics , the smooth movement, the soundtrack  and last but not least the creativity are all just so on point.the ending makes you question everything in life btw, it just brings the whole game's story to another levelIGN 11/10"
